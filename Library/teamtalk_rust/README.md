# Rust library for TeamTalk DLL

This TeamTalk library for Rust development generates a Rust library using
[bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen). bindgen simply parses
[TeamTalk.h](../TeamTalk_DLL/TeamTalk.h) and generates a Rust API for the [TeamTalk DLL](../TeamTalk_DLL).

Use `cargo build` to build the library.
