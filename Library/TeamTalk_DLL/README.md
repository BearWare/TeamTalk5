# TeamTalk C-API header files and libraries

TeamTalk.h contains the API for creating a TeamTalk client
application.

TeamTalkSrv.h contains the API for creating a TeamTalk server
application. The TeamTalk server API is only available in [TeamTalk 5
Professional Edition](http://bearware.dk/?page_id=419).

To get the TeamTalk5 and TeamTalk5Pro DLLs (shared libraries) download
the [TeamTalk 5 SDK](http://bearware.dk/?page_id=419). Alternatively
manually build [TeamTalkLib](../TeamTalkLib) which will output the DLLs into this
folder.
