# TeamTalkLib

Building TeamTalkLib is enabled by toggling the
[CMake](http://www.cmake.org) option *BUILD_TEAMTALK_CORE=ON*. This
will cause CMake to process the TeamTalkLib folder and expose the
build options for TeamTalkLib, e.g.

`# cmake -DBUILD_TEAMTALK_CORE=ON -S TeamTalk5 -B builddir`

## TeamTalk Binaries

Which TeamTalk binaries to build are controlled by CMake options
prefixed by *BUILD_TEAMTALK_*.

## Toolchain Toggles for TeamTalk Binaries

CMake is able to build all TeamTalk's dependencies using the CMake
options prefixed *TOOLCHAIN_*.

On Ubuntu, Raspbian, etc. it may be desirable to use `apt install`
to install TeamTalk dependencies instead of manually building
them. E.g. to build TeamTalk binaries using an installed version of
OpenSSL pass `-DTOOLCHAIN_OPENSSL=OFF`. This will make CMake
compile using the the OpenSSL version installed in
`/usr/include/openssl` instead of building OpenSSL manually.

Being able to build TeamTalk's toolchain requires several dependencies
to be installed on the build machine. Go to TEAMTALK_ROOT/Build and
install the dependencies:

* For macOS run
* `make depend-mac`
* For iOS on macOS run
* `make depend-mac`
* For Ubuntu 18 run:
* `make depend-ubuntu18`
* For Android on Ubuntu 18 run:
* `make depend-ubuntu18`

The following toolchain toggles are available:

* TOOLCHAIN_BUILD_PREFIX
  * Build toolchain dependencies in the specified directory
* TOOLCHAIN_INSTALL_PREFIX
  * Install dependencies in the specified directory  
* TOOLCHAIN_BUILD_EXTERNALPROJECTS
  * When *ON* builds all TeamTalk's dependencies and installs them into
    *TOOLCHAIN_INSTALL_PREFIX*
  * When *OFF* will make TeamTalk binaries build using the libraries
    installed in *TOOLCHAIN_INSTALL_PREFIX*. This is useful to avoid
    building the dependencies again after a new checkout or switching
    branch.
* TOOLCHAIN_OPENSSL
  * When *ON* builds OpenSSL.
  * When *OFF* uses OpenSSL installed on host.
  * *OFF* is only supported on Linux distributions and is recommended,
     since linking different versions of OpenSSL can cause problems.
* TOOLCHAIN_ACE
  * When *ON* builds ACE Framework
  * When *OFF* uses ACE Framework installed on host.
  * *OFF* is only supported on Linux distributions
  * Build ACE on Windows requires *ActivePerl* or *Strawberry Perl*
    * Place `perl.exe` in %PATH%.
* TOOLCHAIN_TINYXML
  * When *ON* builds TinyXML
  * When *OFF* uses TinyXML installed on host.
  * *OFF* is only supported on Linux distributions
* TOOLCHAIN_ZLIB
  * When *ON* builds ZLib
  * When *OFF* uses ZLib installed on host.
  * *OFF* is recommended on Linux, Android, iOS
* TOOLCHAIN_CATCH2
  * When *ON* enables Catch2 for unit tests
  * When *OFF* ignore Catch2 unit tests
* TOOLCHAIN_LIBVPX
  * When *ON* enables LibVPX
  * When *OFF* uses TinyXML installed on host.
  * Building LibVPX on Windows requires Cygwin, https://www.cygwin.com/
    * Install Cygwin in `C:/cygwin64`
  * Building LibVPX on Windows requires yasm, http://yasm.tortall.net/
    * Place `yasm.exe` for x64 in `C:/tt5dist/yasm/x64`
    * Place `yasm.exe` for Win32 in `C:/tt5dist/yasm/win32`
* TOOLCHAIN_FFMPEG
  * When *ON* builds FFmpeg
  * When *OFF* uses FFmpeg installed on host.
  * *OFF* is only supported on Linux distributions
* TOOLCHAIN_OGG
  * When *ON* builds OGG
  * When *OFF* uses OGG installed on host.
  * *OFF* is only supported on Linux distributions
* TOOLCHAIN_OPUS
  * When *ON* builds OPUS
  * When *OFF* uses OPUS installed on host.
  * *OFF* is only supported on Linux distributions
* TOOLCHAIN_PORTAUDIO
  * When *ON* builds PortAudio
  * When *OFF* uses PortAudio installed on host.
  * *OFF* is only supported on Linux distributions
* TOOLCHAIN_SPEEX
  * When *ON* builds Speex
  * When *OFF* uses Speex installed on host.
  * *OFF* is only supported on Linux distributions
