# Main Window {#mainwindow}

The TeamTalk application consists of a menubar, a toolbar, a channels
view in the left side with volume controls below and a tab control
with four tabs to the right. Between the channels view and the tab
control is a so-called splitter which can be used to change the size
of the channels view and tab control.

The following screenshot is included to help explain the TeamTalk
application's user interface.

![TeamTalk main window](main_window.png "Main window")

## Menu Bar {#menubar}

In the top of the application are six menu-items:
[Client](@ref clientmenu), [Me](@ref memenu), [Users](@ref usersmenu),
[Channels](@ref channelsmenu), [Server](@ref servermenu) and
[Help](@ref helpmenu). The *Client-menu* is for configuring the TeamTalk
application and connecting to servers. The *Me-menu* gives access to
options which should be set for the local user (meaning you), like
e.g. changing your nickname or status. The *Users-menu* is used for
interacting with other users, like e.g. changing their sound volume or
sending them text-messages. The *Channels-menu* is used for
controlling channels, like e.g. creating new channels or updating
existing ones. The *Server-menu* is for changing or viewing the server's
options and finally the *Help-menu* is for assistance.

## Toolbar {#toolbar}

The toolbar simply provides easy access to common tasks which are also
available though the menu items.

- **Connect button**
    - The first button in the toolbar, which looks like a plug, is for
    connecting to a server. Once pressed it opens the
    [Connect Dialog](@ref connectdlg).

- **Enable Push to Talk button**
    - The second button in the toolbar, which looks like a button, is
      for enabling a push to talk button. Push to talk is a key
      combination which must be held down whenever you are talking.
      If not push-to-talk key is defined it will open the
      [Push to Talk](@ref pttdlg).

- **Enable Voice Activation button**
    - The third button, which looks like waves, are for enabling voice
    activation. Enabling this will make a slider show up in
    [volume controls](@ref volumecontrols) below the
    [channels view](@ref channelsview). Move this slider left and
    right either changes the voice activation level.
      
- **Enable Video Transmission button**
    - The fourth button, which looks like a webcamera, is for enabling
      video transmission. Before this can be used a camera must be set
      up in the [Video Capture-tab](@ref videocapturetab) in
      Preferences. Once the camera is started one can click the
      [Video-tab](@ref videotab) in the tab control to see one self.

- **Enable Desktop Sharing button**
    - The fifth button, which looks like a blackboard, is for sharing
      a desktop application with other users in the same channel. A
      shared will be displayed in the [Desktop-tab](@ref desktoptab) for
      other users.
  
- **Mute All button**
  - The sixth button in the toolbar, with a speaker icon, is for
    muting all users in the channel you're participating in, so you
    can no longer hear them.
    
- **Recording Conversation to Disk button**
    - The seventh button, which looks like a record button, is for
      storing text chat-logs and audio files to disk. See section
      [Record Conversations to Disk](@ref recorddlg) on how to record
      conversations.
  
- **Show Blinking Icon button**
    - The last button, which looks like a hand, is for enabling the
    *Question status* mode. This will make you appear as a user with a
    blink hand.

## Channels View {#channelsview}

The channels view is in the left side of the application above the
volume controls. Once you have connected to a server you will see
channels and users appearing here.

The channels will appear as folder icons and the computer icon in the
top is also a channel, namely the root channel, where you will first
appear when you connect to a server.

The user impersonating you will appear with bold text, so in the
screenshot below *Bjoern* is me. The blue box surrounding the
user-icon means that I'm currently transmitting video, so the other
users in the channel can see *Bjoern* in the [Video-tab](@ref videotab).

The user *Ida* is also transmitting video but the blinking red line on
her name means that the reception from her is very poor (video data is
being lost). The user *Randi* has a green line over her name which
means that she's currently transmitting audio, i.e. other users in the
channel are hearing her talking. The blackboard behind *Randi*'s
user-icon means that she sharing a desktop application which can be
seen in the [Desktops-tab](@ref desktoptab).

![Channels and users to the left](main_window.png "Channels and users")

Notice that *Bjoern* in the above screenshot has a red star. This means
the user is administrator of the server. The user *Randi* has a yellow
star which means she is operator of the channel and can thereby kick
people out of the channel and modify the channel's settings. People
who are operators are usually the users who created the channel.

The channels view only shows users in channels. To be able to see all
users on the server it's possible to use the
[Online Users Dialog](@ref onlineusersdlg).

## Volume Controls {#volumecontrols}

The volume controls are placed below the channels view. The first
slider with a speaker to the left of it controls the master
volume. Changing this increases or decreases the volume for all
users. If you only want to change the volume of one person you can
select this person and press *Ctrl+Left* arrow to lower volume and
*Ctrl+Right* arrow to increase the volume. These two keyboard
shortcuts are placed in the [Advanced-menu](@ref advancedmenu).

The slider below the master volume with a microphone to the left
controls your microphone's gain level, i.e. amplifying your volume so
you become louder to other users.

To the right of master volume is progressbar with a wave to the left
of it. This progressbar shows how much sound your microphone is
picking up.

If voice activation is enabled the there will be a slider below the
progressbar which sets the voice activation level. When using the
voice activation slider to set the voice activation level ensure that
it is not active all the time, since it can be annoying for other
users. When voice activation becomes active the user in the channels
view impersonating you will become green.

## Chat Tab {#chattab}

The Chat-tab is used for text chatting with the people in your
channel. A screenshot is shown there:

![Chat-tab in main window](main_window.png "Chat-tab")

The Chat-tab also maintains a list of events which occurred in your
channel, like e.g. when a new user joins or leaves the channel. To
send a text message to all users in your channel simply type in the
line to the left of the Send-button. If the server supports channel
commands it's also possible to send commands to the server using
channel text messages.

## Video Tab {#videotab}

The Video-tab contains a grid of all the users who are currently
transmitting video to the channel. The users who are transmitting
video will have a blue frame around their user icon in the channels
view as can be seen in the following screenshot:

![Video-tab in main window](main_videotab.png "Video-tab")

The button with the '-' sign in the Video-tab can be used to remove
users from the grid so you will no longer receive video data from that
user.

Pressing the button with the '+' sign will add the user to the grid
again.

The button with the two frames, one above the other, is for detaching
a user from the grid so the user will be shown in a separate window.

The last button the Video-tab is for starting and stopping your video
camera. If you want other users to also see video sent from you press
the video camera in the toolbar to the right of the voice activation
icon.

## Desktops Tab {#desktoptab}

The Desktops-tab contains a grid of shared desktop applications. Here
is a screenshot of a shared desktop application:

![Desktop-tab in main window](main_desktoptab.png "Desktop-tab")

Moving your mouse over the desktop window will show who owns the
desktop. Press and hold the mouse to scroll the window if it's bigger
than the Desktops tab. Check out the
[Desktop Share section](@ref desktopsharedlg) on how to share a desktop
application.

## Files Tab {#filestab}

If the server allows, users can upload and download files to and from
a channel. When you join a channel you can see the files which are
currently available in the Files-tab as shown in this screenshot:

![Files-tab in main window](main_filestab.png "Files-tab")

Only users who have a user account on the server can upload
files. Anyone can download files in a channel. Only the owner of a
file, an administrator or an operator of a channel can delete a
file. Instead of using the upload and download button in the Files-tab
one can also drag/drop files from Windows' Explorer.

# Client-Menu {#clientmenu}

The Client-menu is used for connecting to TeamTalk servers and
configuring the TeamTalk application.

![Client-menu of main window](menu_client.png "Client-menu")

Each of the menu items in the Client menu are described here:

- **New Client Instance**
    - Start a new TeamTalk instance, so you're able to connect to
      multiple servers. When starting a new instance you'll be asked
      to set up a profile. That way it's possible have use different
      configurations depending on which server you're connected to.
      There's a maximum of 16 profiles.
- **Connect**
    - To connect to a new server or one you have connected to
      recently. For more information read section
      [Connect Dialog](@ref connectdlg).

## Connect Dialog {#connectdlg}

In the Connect dialog you can specify the TeamTalk server you want to
connect to. It also maintains a list of publicly available TeamTalk
servers you can connect to. An example of public TeamTalk servers are
shown in the screenshot below. The public servers will be shown in
green.

![Connect to server dialog](dlg_connect.png "Connect dialog")

If you manually want to connect to a TeamTalk server then the person
who is running the server must provide the information for the fields
Host IP-address, TCP port and UDP port along with a user account
containing both username and password. If the server is hosted on an
encrypted connection then the *Encrypted server* option must be
checked.

### Authentication

Most TeamTalk server owners set up their own usernames and passwords
for users. Some TeamTalk servers also support a publicly available login
system provided by BearWare.dk.

- BearWare.dk Web Login
  - If the username to log on to a server is "bearware" then you must
    register a username on BearWare.dk and use this to log on to the
    server.

Learn more about setting up user accounts by read the section on
[configuring TeamTalk servers](@ref teamtalkserver) or the section
about [User Accounts](@ref useraccountsdlg).

### Join specific channel after authentication

To join a specific channel once you have logged on to the server can
be done by filling out Channel and Password fields. Once you have
filled out all the information you have been provided you can save the
server to the Server List by filling the Entry name field and
afterwards click **Save**. Finally click **Connect** to connect to the
server.

### Import .tt File

Other users can send you [.tt files](ref ttfiles) that have been
[generated](ref ttfile) to contain the information you need to join
their server.

### Generate .tt File

If you want others to connect to the same TeamTalk server as you, you
can press **Generate .tt File** so you'll generate a file you can email to
the users who should also connect to the server. More information
about the [Generate .tt File Dialog](@ref ttfile) is available
[here](@ref ttfile).

### Publish Publicly

You can publish your own TeamTalk server as a "private server" so
others can join it from the list when "Include private servers (orange
ones)" is checked.

## Preferences Dialog {#preferencesdlg}

The Preferences dialog is used for configuring the TeamTalk
application. Users should at least run through the
[General](@ref generaltab) and [Sound System](@ref soundsystemtab)-tabs to
ensure everything is configured properly.

![Preferences Dialog](pref_general.png "Preferences dialog")

Please read section [TeamTalk Preferences](@ref preferences) for a guide
on how to configure TeamTalk.

## Sound Configuration-Menu {#soundconfigmenu}

The Sound Configuration submenu is used for quick access to settings
that are otherwise in [Preferences Dialog](@ref preferencesdlg)'s
[Sound System](@ref soundsystemtab)-tab.

![Sound input device selection](menu_soundconfig.png "Sound Configuration's Inputs submenu")

Echo cancellation, automatic gain control and denoising can be enabled
using shortcut keys. The currently active sound input devices and
sound output devices can also be selected in **Input Devices** and
**Output Devices** submenu.

Sound input devices with the **[Loopback]]** postfix sends audio
played on the select input device back into TeamTalk as its microphone input.

## Record Conversations to Disk {#recorddlg}

Conversations with others users, both audio and text messages, can be
stored to disk using the *Record Conversations to Disk* dialog in
[Client-menu](@ref clientmenu) or by pressing the recorder button in the
toolbar.

The record conversations dialog looks as follows:

![Record Conversations to Disk dialog](dlg_record.png "Record Conversations to Disk")

Each of the items in the dialog are explained here:

- **Storage mode**
    - **Single audio file for all users**
        - Audio from all users in your channel is merged into a single
          file.
    - **Separate audio file for each user**
        - Each user in your channel will have a separate audio file
          every time the person starts talking.
- **Audio file format**
    - The file format to use for storing audio files. Choosing
      ogg-format will store in the audio codec format selected by the
      channel. The <a href="https://www.videolan.org">VLC
      media player</a> can play ogg-format.
- **Folder for audio files**
    - The file name for the audio files is generated automatically but the
      folder for storing the files has to be specified in this field.

    - When joining a channel a new log file will be created in this
      folder containing the date and channel name.
- **Folder for user-to-user log files**
    - When receiving a text message from another user a new log file
      will be created in this folder with the nickname of the user.

# Me-Menu {#memenu}

The menu items in the menu group Me are options you want to perform on
yourself. The possible options are shown here.

![Me-menu items](menu_me.png "Me-menu")

Each of the menu items in the Me-menu are described here:

- **Change Nickname**
    - This will change your name on the server. Your current nickname
      is the one shown in bold text in the channels view. The nickname
      is simply a display name. It has no relation to your username
      (if you have a user account). In @ref useraccountsdlg it's
      possible to lock the nickname so it cannot be changed. This is
      especially useful if you use BearWare.dk Web Login
      and want people to use their registered name.
- **Change Status**
    - This is used to change your status mode, like e.g. Available,
      Away, Question-mode and set a message regarding your current
      status.
- **Hear myself**
  - When in a channel this option can be used to hear your self to
    e.g. determine your voice level. This is actually the same as
    subscribing to your own voice stream in [Subscription-menu](@ref
    subscriptionsmenu).
- **Enable Push To Talk**
    - Push To Talk is a key combination you need to hold down whenever
      you are talking. Using a [Push To Talk](@ref pttdlg) key combination
      is especially usefull if you are using speakers and have
      problems with echos. To transmit voice data from microphone
      requires the *User Right*
      [User can transmit voice data](@ref useraccountsdlg).
- **Enable Voice Activation**
    - Instead of using Push To Talk one can have TeamTalk detect when
      you are talking and then start transmitting. To transmit voice
      data from microphone requires the *User Right*
      [User can transmit voice data](@ref useraccountsdlg).
- **Enable Video Transmission**
    - Enable this item to start transmitting video to other users in
      your channel. Note that you need to configure your web camera
      before doing this. To transmit video data from webcam requires
      the *User Right* [User can transmit video data](@ref useraccountsdlg).
- **Enable Desktop Sharing**
    - Share an application on your desktop with other users in your
      channel. This can e.g. be used for doing a presentation. See the
      [Desktop Sharing dialog](@ref desktopsharedlg) for more information.
      To transmit shared desktops requires the *User Right*
      [User can transmit desktop sessions](@ref useraccountsdlg).
- **Notifications**
  - Sub menu items to enable/disable [Sound Events](@ref
    soundeventstab) and [Text to Speech](@ref texttospeechtab).

## Enable Push To Talk Dialog {#pttdlg}

Using Push To Talk is a good way to ensure people do not overlap each
other when they are talking and to avoid echos from speakers. To set
up a hotkey simply hold down the keys you want to use as your key
combination and release them all again. The Push To Talk dialog will
show the keys you're holding down like here.

![Push To Talk Dialog](dlg_ptt.png "Push To Talk")

Using *Ctrl* is a good choice for a Push To Talk key. Note that using
regular keys can make Windows beep unlike when using non-modifier keys
like Ctrl, Alt, Shift. Therefore Ctrl or Alt or Shift is recommended.

## Enable Desktop Sharing Dialog {#desktopsharedlg}

The window of an application on your desktop can be shared with other
users in the same channel. This can be used for doing a presentation
in an eLearning scenario.

The Desktop Sharing dialog is shown here:

![Desktop Sharing Dialog](dlg_desktopshare.png "Desktop Sharing")

To be able to share a desktop window requires the *User Right*
[User can transmit desktop sessions](@ref useraccountsdlg).

Each of the items in the dialog are explained here:

- **Share entire desktop**
    - Instead of sharing only one application you can share your
      entire desktop. Note that this may require a lot of bandwidth
      usage.
- **Share active window**
    - Share the window on your desktop which currently have keyboard
      and mouse focus. This option is useful if you intend to show
      several application windows during your presentation.
- **Share specific window**
    - Only share a single application window and it has to be the one
      with the title specified in the selection box.
- **Color mode**
    - The more colors you use for showing your application the better
      it looks, but it also requires mode bandwidth.
- **Update interval**
    - Enable this option if the window you're sharing changes during
      your presentation. TeamTalk will then update the window on a
      timely basis.
- **Share desktop cursor**
    - Enable this option if remote users should be able to see where
      your mouse cursor is point to.

# Users-Menu {#usersmenu}

The menu items in the Users-menu are used for changing the settings of
other users and interacting with them. The Users-menu is shown here:

![Users-menu items](menu_users.png "Users menu")

Each of the menu items in the Users menu are described here. A user
has to be selected in the channels view for the Users menu items to be
active.

- **User Information**
    - **View User Information**
      - Use this menu item to get extended information about a user,
        like e.g. username, user type and packet reception.
    - **Speak User Information**
      - Use Text-To-Speech to speak user information.
- **Messages**
    - The menu item is for sending user to user text messages. A
      message dialog will pop up on the user's computer when you send
      him a message. This option can however be disabled in the
      Display tab in Preferences.
- **Allow Desktop Access**
    - If you're sharing a desktop window using
      [desktop sharing](@ref desktopsharedlg) then you can allow the users
      you select in the [channel view](@ref channelsview) to control mouse
      and keyboard on your computer by enabling this menu item. Note
      that **Allow Desktop Access** is actually the same as enabling the
      **Desktop Access**-subscription in
      [Subscription-menu](@ref subscriptionsmenu).
- **Op**
    - *Op* is short for channel-operator. Read section
      [Channel Operators](@ref op) to learn more about channel
      operators.
- **Volume**
    - If a user is either too loud or too quiet one can use the volume
      dialog to turn the volume up and down. Most users would probably
      prefer to use the volume controls in the
      [Advanced-menu](@ref advancedmenu).
- **Mute**
    - **Mute Voice**
        - Mute the user's voice stream so you will not hear audio from
          this person. Note that you will still receive audio data
          from the user. To also disable the voice stream completely
          look in the [Subscriptions-menu](@ref subscriptionsmenu).
    - **Mute Media File**
        - Mute the user's audio media file stream so you will not hear
          audio from this person. Note that you will still receive
          audio data from the user. To also disable the media file
          stream completely look in the
          [Subscriptions-menu](@ref subscriptionsmenu).
- **Kick**
    - **Kick from channel**
        - Kick the user out of the channel.
    - **Kick and Ban From Channel**
        - Ensure the user cannot join the channel again by banning either
          the person's username or IP-address.
    - **Kick from server**
        - Kick the user off the server so the person has to log in
          again.
    - **Kick and Ban From Server**
        - Kick the user off the server and ban the user's username or
          IP-address. Only users with the
          [User can ban users from server](@ref useraccountsdlg)
          *User Right* can do this.
- **Subscriptions**
    - See [Subscriptions-menu](@ref subscriptionsmenu).
- **Transmit Control**
    - See [Transmit Control-menu](@ref transmitcontrolmenu).
- **Advanced**
    - See [Advanced-menu](@ref advancedmenu).
- **Mute All**
    - Mute the sound from all users, both voice streams and media file
    streams.

## Channel Operators {#op}

A channel operator is typically a channel owner, i.e. the user who
initially created the channel. As channel operator one can kick people
out of the channel, make changes to the channel's properties and
control who can transmit in the channel.

Being channel operator is similar to having the *User Right*
[User can create/modify all channels](@ref useraccountsdlg) but
instead of "all channels" the user can only make changes to the
channels which the user is operator of.
      
When [creating a channel](@ref createchandlg) one can also set an
*Operator password* so others can become channel-operators by
entering this password.

In the [User Accounts Dialog](@ref useraccountsdlg) it's possible to set
up users to automatically become channel operators.

As channel operator use the [Transmit Control](@ref transmitcontrolmenu)
to toggle who can transmit to the channel.

## Subscriptions-Menu {#subscriptionsmenu}

Subscriptions are used for ignoring certain data or events from a
user. If e.g. you do not want to receive text messages from a certain
user you can tell the server that you want to unsubscribe text
messages from that user.

![Subscriptions-menu items](menu_subscriptions.png "Subscriptions menu")

Each of the menu items in the Subscriptions-menu are described here.

- **User Messages**
    - If checked you accept text messages from this user. 
- **Channel Messages**
    - If checked you accept channel text messages from this user.
- **Broadcast Messages**
    - If checked you accept broadcast messages from this user. Only
      administrators can by default broadcast text messages.
- **Voice**
    - If checked you accept microphone audio from this user. Unlike Mute
      in [Users-menu](@ref usersmenu) disabling this will also stop the user
      from sending audio data to you.
- **Video**
    - If checked you accept video from this user. Unsubscribing video is
      the same as pressing the minus button in the [Video-tab](@ref videotab).
- **Desktop**
    - If checked you accept shared desktop windows from this
      user. Unsubscribing Desktop is the same as pressing the minus
      button in the [Desktops-tab](@ref desktoptab).
- **Desktop Access**
    - If checked and you're [sharing a desktop](@ref desktopsharedlg) then
      you allow the selected user to take control of your mouse and
      keyboard.
- **Media File**
    - If checked you accept audio and video streams of media files
      from this user. Media files are streamed using
      [Stream Media File to Channel](@ref streammediadlg).

- **Intercept User Messages**
    - Receive all the user's text messages, both to usee and to all
      other users the user is sending to. In other words this is like
      spying on the user. Only administrators can do this.
- **Intercept Channel Messages**
    - Receive all the user's channel text messages, even if you're not
      in the user's channel. Only administrators can do this.
- **Intercept Voice**
    - Receive audio from this user, even if you're not in the same
      channel. Only administrators can do this.
- **Intercept Video**
    - Receive video from this user, even if you're not in the same
      channel. Only administrators can do this.
- **Intercept Desktop**
    - Receive shared desktop windows from this user, even if you're
      not in the same channel. Only administrators can do this.

If there's certain subscriptions you always want to have disabled by
default you can set these in the [Connection-tab](@ref connectiontab) of
the [Preferences](@ref preferences) dialog.

## Create Channel Dialog {#createchandlg}

To chat with other users in TeamTalk one has to either create a
channel or join an existing channel. A new channel can be created by
pressing F7 and the following dialog will show up:

![Create Channel Dialog](dlg_createchan.png "Create Channel")

Each of the fields in the create channel dialog are described here:

- **Channel Path**
    - Each channel can have subchannels which again can have
      subchannels. In TeamTalk channels are separated with / and the
      full path of your new channel will be displayed here.
- **Channel name**
    - The name of your new channel. Ensure that / is not in the name.
- **Topic**
    - Each channel can have a topic which both users who are in the
      channel and who are not in the channel can read.
- **Password**
    - The password required to join the channel (optional).
- **Operator password**
    - The first person to create a new channel will automatically
      become operator of that channel. This means the user can kick
      people out of the channel and update its settings later on. If
      the person leaves the channel at some point and comes back that
      person can click the [Op](@ref op) item in the
      [Users-menu](@ref usersmenu) to become operator again.
- **Max users**
    - The maximum number of users allowed in the channel.
- **Disk quota (KBytes)**
    - The maximum number of KBytes available for file storage in the
      channel when [uploading files](@ref channelsmenu). This field can only
      be modified if user has *User Right*
      [User can create/modify all channels](@ref useraccountsdlg). The
      default *Disk Quota* is set up when
      [configuring the TeamTalk server](@ref teamtalkserver).
      
- **Permanent channel (stored on server)**
    - Only users with *User Right*
      [User can create/modify all channels](@ref useraccountsdlg) can
      create permanent channels.
- **No interruptions (no simultaneous voice transmission)**
    - If this option is enabled only one person can talk in the
      channel. In other words where will be no overlapping
      conversations. To talk in this type of channel you must wait
      until the channel becomes "silent". In Sound Events in
      Preferences there's an option to play a sound when a channel is
      "free for chat".
- **Classroom (operator-controlled transmission)**
    - If this option is enabled the [channel operator](@ref op) can
      control who is allowed to talk, send video and share desktops in
      the channel. See section [classroom](@ref classroom) for more
      information.
- **Operator receive only (only operator see and hear users)**
    - This channel type can be used for reducing network traffic when
      e.g. TeamTalk is used for teaching. Only user's with *User Right*
      [User can create/modify all channels](@ref useraccountsdlg) and
      [operators](@ref op) of a channel will see and hear users in the
      channel.
- **No voice activation (only Push-To-Talk allowed)**
    - Enable this channel type to disallow [voice activation](@ref memenu)
- **No audio recording allowed (save to disk not allowed)**
    - Don't allow users to use the
      [Record Conversations to Disk](@ref recorddlg) option.
- **Hidden channel**
    - Create a hidden channel that can only be seen by users with
      *User Right* [User can see hidden channels](@ref useraccountsdlg).
      Creating a hidden channel requires *User Right*
      [User can create/modify all channels](@ref useraccountsdlg).
      To join a hidden channel that cannot be seen use the *Create
      Channel Dialog* and type the name of the channel, its password
      and press OK. Ensure to be in the parent channel of the hidden
      channel while doing this.
    - A hidden channel must be a sub channel with no other sub channels,
      i.e. a leaf node.
    - Note that it is not possible to update an existing channel to a
      hidden channel, and vice versa.

- **Audio Codec**
    - **Codec Type**
        - In TeamTalk each channel must specify which audio codec all
          users in the channel must use to join the channel. TeamTalk
          currently supports Speex and OPUS.
    - **OPUS codec**
        - **Application**
            - Use *VoIP* if channel is primarily used for users
              talking together. Use *Music* if channel is primarily
              used for streaming high quality audio, like e.g. music.
        - **Sample Rate**
            - The sample rate to use. The higher the better audio
              quality.
        - **Audio Channels**
            - Mono or Stereo. OPUS automatically switches to mono if
            bitrate is less than 30 kbit.
        - **Bitrate**
            - The bitrate to use. OPUS supports 6-510 KBit/sec.
        - **Variable Bitrate**
            - Enable to reduce bandwidth usage.
        - **Ignore silence (DTX)**
            - Discontinuous transmission (DTX), i.e. if the OPUS
              codec detects there's silence then it will output
              empty packets to conserve bandwidth.
        - **Transmit interval**
            - The number of milliseconds of recorded audio before the
              TeamTalk client should transmit. If transmit interval is
              higher than 120 msec then a *Frame size* must be specified.
        - **Frame size**
            - A higher frame size gives less bandwidth usage but more
              latency. If transmit interval is higher than 120 msec
              then a frame size must be specified.

    - **Speex codec**
        - **Sample rate**
            - The sample rate to use. The higher the better audio
              quality.
        - **Quality**
            - Increasing the quality will require more bandwidth but the
              sound quality will get better. Ensure to use a setting which
              is not higher than everyone you want to talk to have an
              Internet connection which supports the required bandwidth.
        - **Transmit interval**
            - The number of milliseconds of recorded audio before the
              TeamTalk client should transmit.

    - **Speex Variable Bitrate**
        - **Sample rate**
            - The sample rate to use. The higher the better audio
              quality.
        - **Quality**
            - Increasing the quality will require more bandwidth but the
              sound quality will get better. Ensure to use a setting which
              is not higher than everyone you want to talk to have an
              Internet connection which supports the required bandwidth.
        - **Max bitrate**
            - The encoder should stay below this bitrate.
        - **Ignore silence (DTX)**
            - Discontinuous transmission (DTX), i.e. if the OPUS
              codec detects there's silence then it will output
              empty packets to conserve bandwidth.
        - **Transmit interval**
             - The number of milliseconds of recorded audio before the
               TeamTalk client should transmit.

- **Enable fixed audio volume for all users**
    - In most cases users have microphones with different audio volume
      levels which makes some users louder than others. Enabling this
      option ensures that all users in the channel speaks at the same
      audio volume level. Note that this option may reduce audio
      quality.
- **Volume level**
    - The reference volume all users in the channel should use.
    
## Classroom Channel Type {#classroom}

If there's many people in a channel it's often nescessary for someone
to control who is talking. The *classroom channel type* can be used
for controlling which users are allowed to transmit audio, video and
media files to a channel.

If a channel is configured as a classroom then the
[channels view](@ref channelsview) will look something like this:

![Classroom channel from channel-operator's perspective](main_classroom.png "Classroom channel")

The checkboxes in front of each user are used to control who can
transmit to the channel. In the above screenshot *Ida* and *Liv* are
e.g. allowed to transmit video from webcams. The user *Randi* is
allowed to transmit shared desktop but cannot transmit video since she
is not checked.

As can be seen on the screenshot there's also checkboxes to the right
of the channel name *Room 11B*. These checkboxes can be used as a
shortcut for allowing everyone to transmit. So voice and media files
can be transmitted by anyone in the channel.

As an alternative to the checkboxes it's also possible to use the
[Transmit Control menu](@ref transmitcontrolmenu) to toggle who can
transmit.

For a non-operator of the classroom channel the view of the *Room 11B*
channel will look like this:

![Classroom channel for non-operator's perspective](main_classroom_nop.png "Classroom channel without control")

A non-operator cannot modify any of the transmission settings. They
will have to ask the channel-operator to toggle the checkboxes for
transmission.


## Stream Media File to Channel Dialog {#streammediadlg}

In the [Channels-menu](@ref channelsmenu) there's an option to stream
media files to others users in the same channel. For fast access the
play icon in the [toolbar](@ref toolbar) can also be used.

Here's an example of streaming a media file with video content to a
channel:

![Stream Media File to Channel](dlg_streammedia.png "Stream media file")

The users receiving the media stream can use the volume dialog in
[Users-menu](@ref usersmenu) to control the volume level of the media
file. If it's media file containing video content then the video can
be seen in the [video-tab](@ref videotab).

# Server-Menu {#servermenu}

The Server-menu is mainly intended for server administrators to
administrate users who have access to the server. The Server-menu

      useraccountsdlg).

- **Banned Users**
    - List all the users who are banned from the server. Users are
      banned based on their IP-address. Since user's IP-addresses
      often change from day to day it might be that a user who was
      previously banned can log on to the server again a day or two
      later. Only users with *User Right*
      [User can ban users from server](@ref useraccountsdlg)
      can list the banned users on a server. More is

      [Server Properties Dialog](@ref serverpropertiesdlg).
- **Save Configuration**
    - Save the server's current state, i.e. save the current server
      properties and all permanent channels. If *Auto save server
      changes* is checked in [Server Properties](@ref serverpropertiesdlg)
      all new permanent channels are saved automatically. Also channels
      which are deleted are removed from the server's configuration.

- **Server Statistics**
    - Get incoming and outgoing bandwidth usage.

## User Accounts Dialog {#useraccountsdlg}

For users to log on to a TeamTalk server they must have a user
account. Only users of user-type *Administrator* can create/modify
user accounts. When the TeamTalk server is [configured](@ref teamtalkserver)
initially an administrator account can be set up so
further user accounts can be created using this user accounts
dialog.

Here is shown the User Accounts-dialog.

      not be used until next time the server is restarted.

      new port will not be used until next time the server is
      restarted.
- **User timeout**
    - The number of seconds a user can stay on the server without
