# TeamTalk 5 Classic for Accessibility {#classic}

Historically TeamTalk 5 Classic for Windows has been the preferred
client for users using screen-readers. However, in TeamTalk v5.8 and
onwards the default TeamTalk client (often referred to as Qt client)
has received many accessibility improvements. Therefore users are
encouraged to switch to the default TeamTalk client in order to try
out the latest features.

As of TeamTalk v5.8 the TeamTalk 5 Classic client only receives
bugfixes and no new features are implemented in the client.

The TeamTalk 5 Classic client is still included in the Windows
installer, so users can continue using it. But please give the default
TeamTalk client a try.

# Install TeamTalk 5 Classic {#installclassic}

The keyboard menu shortcuts are the same in the Classic client as in
the regular client. The Classic client doesn't have a [Video-tab](@ref videotab)
and [Desktop-tab](@ref desktoptab). Video and desktop
sessions are opened in separate windows when running the Classic
client. To ignore video and desktop session completely look into
[Default Subscriptions](@ref connectiontab).
