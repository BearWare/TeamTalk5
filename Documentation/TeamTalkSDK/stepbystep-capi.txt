/** @page stepbystep Client Programming Guide
 *
 * The following sections gives a step-by-step tour of building a user
 * application which uses the TeamTalk C-API DLL to transmit voice
 * and video. In order for the user application to interact with other
 * clients a TeamTalk server must first be set up. Section @ref
 * serversetup explains how to do this.
 *
 * The job of the TeamTalk server is to keep track of connected users
 * and provide user autentication. Once a client is connected and has
 * been authenticated the client is presented with a tree structure
 * where each node is a so-called channel which the client can join
 * and from there interact with the other users who are in the same
 * channel.
 *
 * The following six steps explains how to build a TeamTalk client:
 *
 * - @ref stepinit
 * - @ref stepdevs
 * - @ref stepconnect
 * - @ref steplogon
 * - @ref stepjoin
 * - @ref steptx
 *
 * @section stepinit Step 1: Create a TeamTalk Client Instance
 *
 * A new client instance is created by calling TT_InitTeamTalkPoll()
 * which will return a #TTInstance pointer to the new client
 * instance. When the user application quits ensure to call
 * TT_CloseTeamTalk() with the returned #TTInstance so the client
 * instance can close down properly.
 *
 * Once a new client instance has been created its current state can
 * always be retrieved by calling the function TT_GetFlags() which will
 * return a bitmask describing the client's current state. Initially
 * after creating the client instance a call to TT_GetFlags() will
 * return a bitmask with the value #CLIENT_CLOSED since no operations
 * have been performed on the client.
 *
 * @section stepdevs Step 2: Initialize Sound and Video Devices
 *
 * Before connecting to a server it is a good idea to setup the user's
 * sound and video devices. Sound devices are initialized using the
 * TT_InitSoundInputDevice() and TT_InitSoundOutputDevice()
 * functions. The video capture device is initialized using
 * TT_InitVideoCaptureDevice(). Initializing the video capture device
 * can be quite tricky because there's many properties which needs to
 * be configured. Look at the SDK sample applications to see how it's
 * done.
 *
 * Once sound and video devices has been initialized the function
 * TT_GetFlags() will return a mask containing
 * #CLIENT_SNDINPUT_READY, #CLIENT_SNDOUTPUT_READY and
 * #CLIENT_VIDEOCAPTURE_READY.
 *
 * @section stepconnect Step 3: Connect to a TeamTalk Server
 *
 * Calling TT_Connect() will make the client connect to the server
 * running on the IP-address and port numbers specified as parameters
 * to the function. After this call the TT_GetFlags() function will
 * have the #CLIENT_CONNECTING bit set. TT_Connect() is a non-blocking
 * call so the user application must query the client instance for
 * events by calling TT_GetMessage() to see if a connection has been
 * established. 
 *
 * If the TT_Connect() call fails the event #CLIENTEVENT_CON_FAILED
 * will be posted to the event queue and retrieved by TT_GetMessage()
 * and the #CLIENT_CONNECTING bit will be cleared.
 *
 * If the TT_Connect() is successful the event
 * #CLIENTEVENT_CON_SUCCESS will be posted to the event queue and the
 * #CLIENT_CONNECTED bit will be set and #CLIENT_CONNECTING will be
 * cleared.
 *
 * @section steplogon Step 4: Log on to a TeamTalk Server
 *
 * Once connected the user application can call TT_DoLogin() to log on
 * to the server. All functions with the prefix TT_Do* are client to
 * server commands (see @ref commands). The TT_DoLogin() requires that
 * the user application provides a username and password for a user
 * account on the server.
 *
 * TT_DoLogin() is also a non-blocking call so the client instance's
 * message queue must be queried, using TT_GetMessage(), to see if the
 * login was successful.  If the server rejects the login the event
 * #CLIENTEVENT_CMD_ERROR is posted along with an error code (see
 * #ClientError).
 *
 * If the server accepts the login information the
 * #CLIENTEVENT_CMD_SUCCESS event is posted and the the client
 * instance will have the #CLIENT_AUTHORIZED flag set.
 *
 * For every channel on the server a #CLIENTEVENT_CMD_CHANNEL_NEW
 * event will be posted and a #CLIENTEVENT_CMD_USER_LOGGEDIN will be
 * posted for every user logged on to the server. The
 * #CLIENTEVENT_CMD_USER_JOINED event follows which tells if the user
 * is in a channel.
 *
 * @section stepjoin Step 5: Join a channel on the TeamTalk Server
 *
 * Now that the client is connected and authorized it is possible to
 * join a channel on the server. This is done by either calling the
 * function TT_DoJoinChannel() to create a new channel or by calling
 * #TT_DoJoinChannelByID() to join an existing channel.
 *
 * If using the TT_DoJoinChannelByID() command to join a channel the
 * ID of the channel must be retrieved and also the password needed to
 * join the channel. The ID of a channel is posted in the
 * #CLIENTEVENT_CMD_CHANNEL_NEW event and the password (if any) must
 * be provided by the user.
 *
 * If the call to TT_DoJoinChannelByID() is successful the event
 * #CLIENTEVENT_CMD_SUCCESS is posted and if the server rejected
 * the command to join the #CLIENTEVENT_CMD_ERROR event is posted.
 *
 * @section steptx Step 6: Transmit data to users in a Channel
 * 
 * Having joined a channel now enables the client instance to start
 * transmitting audio and video to the other users in the channel by
 * calling TT_EnableVoiceTransmission() and
 * TT_StartVideoCaptureTransmission().
 *
 * When the other users in the channel starts receiving audio they
 * will receive the #CLIENTEVENT_USER_STATECHANGE event. If video is also
 * being transmitted the event #CLIENTEVENT_USER_VIDEOCAPTURE will be
 * posted for every video frame which is received.
