 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * The TeamTalk SDK enables developers to quickly develop applications
 * with instant messaging, voice over IP (VoIP), desktop sharing and
 * video capturing capabilities. Examples of such applications could
 * be Internet phones, conferencing tools, surveillance systems,
 * e-Learning systems, or any other type of application where audio
 * and video transmission between networked clients is an essential
 * part of the application.
 *
 * The fastest way to get an overview of the features available in the
 * TeamTalk SDK is to download the TeamTalk application from the
 * http://www.bearware.dk website. The TeamTalk application uses the
 * C-API DLL which is included with this SDK. On the website is also
 * listed public TeamTalk servers which can be used freely for testing
 * the application.
 *
 * To quickly get started developing your own TeamTalk client
 * application please read the @ref stepbystep or simply try out the
 * @ref examples included with the SDK.
