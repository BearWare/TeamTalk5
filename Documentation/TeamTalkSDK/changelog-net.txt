 * @section v58arelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.8a release, June 24th 2021
 *
 * @subsection v58afeatures New features in v5.8a
 *
 * @subsubsection v58amixed Store audio from multiple stream types
 *
 * Previously it was only possible to store audio from
 * #BearWare.StreamType.STREAMTYPE_VOICE to either a file or #BearWare.AudioBlock. In TeamTalk
 * v5.8a it's now possible to have the TeamTalk instance mix several
 * stream types into a single audio stream.
 *
 * To record multiple audio streams, i.e. #BearWare.StreamType.STREAMTYPE_VOICE,
 * #BearWare.StreamType.STREAMTYPE_LOCALMEDIAPLAYBACK_AUDIO and
 * #BearWare.StreamType.STREAMTYPE_MEDIAFILE_AUDIO, use
 * BearWare.TeamTalkBase.StartRecordingMuxedStreams(). The #BearWare.StreamType can be OR'ed to
 * mix the wanted combination.
 * 
 * To retrieve #BearWare.AudioBlock with mixed audio use
 * BearWare.TeamTalkBase.EnableAudioBlockEvent().
 *
 * @subsection v58aapi API change in v5.8a
 *
 * - New enum value #BearWare.StreamType.STREAMTYPE_LOCALMEDIAPLAYBACK_AUDIO for
 *   BearWare.TeamTalkBase.InitLocalPlayback() playback.
 * - New field @c uStreamTypes on #BearWare.AudioBlock denoting which 
 *   streams were mixed into the #BearWare.AudioBlock.
 * - New function BearWare.TeamTalkBase.StartRecordingMuxedStreams() to record 
 *   multiple #BearWare.StreamType to a single file.
 *

 *
 * @section v57arelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.7a release, March 4th 2021
 *
 * @subsection v57afeatures New features in v5.7a
 *
 * @subsubsection v57awebrtc WebRTC Audio Preprocessor
 *
 * Previously #BearWare.SpeexDSP was the only support audio preprocessor for
 * noise suppression, echo cancellation and automatic gain control
 * (AGC). In TeamTalk v5.7 it's now possible to use WebRTC's audio
 * preprocessor which work significantly better than the echo
 * cancellor in SpeexDSP and platform echo cancellors supported
 * through #SoundDeviceFeature.SOUNDDEVICEFEATURE_AEC.
 *
 * Read more about WebRTC's audio preprocessor using the
 * #BearWare.WebRTCAudioPreprocessor-struct.
 *
 * @subsubsection v57aclassroom Classroom support for channel text messages
 *
 * Previously it was only possible to control #StreamType.STREAMTYPE_VOICE,
 * #StreamType.STREAMTYPE_MEDIAFILE, #StreamType.STREAMTYPE_VIDEOCAPTURE and
 * #StreamType.STREAMTYPE_DESKTOP in a classroom using @c transmitUsers on
 * #BearWare.Channel-struct. Now #StreamType.STREAMTYPE_CHANNELMSG has been added so it's
 * also possible to enable/disable channel text messages sent through
 * TeamTalkBase.DoTextMessage().
 *
 * @subsubsection v57ahiddenchan Hidden channels
 *
 * A new channel type #ChannelType.CHANNEL_HIDDEN has been introduced which makes
 * a channel invisible to users who do not have
 * #UserRight.USERRIGHT_VIEW_HIDDEN_CHANNELS. Users who cannot see the channel
 * are still able to join it given that they know its name and
 * password. Only users with #UserRight.USERRIGHT_MODIFY_CHANNELS are able to
 * create hidden channels.
 *
 * Use TeamTalkBase.DoMakeChannel() or TeamTalkBase.DoJoinChannel() to create a hidden
 * channel.
 *
 * @subsubsection v57acrypt Client/Server peer verification for encryption
 *
 * Both client and server are now able to verify that the remote end
 * is a valid user using TLS peer verification. Peer verfication is
 * set up in #BearWare.EncryptionContext and enable using
 * TeamTalkBase.SetEncryptionContext() on the client and
 * TeamTalkSrvBase.SetEncryptionContext() on the server.
 *
 * @subsubsection v57ajitter Jitter buffer for voice stream
 *
 * Compensation for network jitter can now be enabled using
 * #BearWare.JitterConfig and activated using TeamTalkBase.SetUserJitterControl(). The
 * jitter configuration allows a buffer to build up before playback
 * starts. Remember to also increase the allowed buffer size by
 * calling TeamTalkBase.SetUserAudioStreamBufferSize().
 *
 * @subsubsection v57aopus Stream OPUS .ogg files on Windows
 *
 * TeamTalkBase.StartStreamingMediaFileToChannel() now support OPUS .ogg files
 * on Windows. This allows playback of files recorded using
 * TeamTalkBase.SetUserMediaStorageDir() or TeamTalkBase.StartRecordingMuxedAudioFile().
 *
 * @subsubsection v57acryptcontext Multiple encryption contexts for TeamTalk server
 *
 * Previously it was only possible to set one #BearWare.EncryptionContext for
 * all TeamTalk server instance, i.e. #BearWare.TeamTalkSrvBase, but now each
 * server instance can have its own by calling
 * TeamTalkSrvBase.SetEncryptionContext().
 *
 * @subsection v57aapi API changes in v5.7a
 *
 * - New enum value #SoundDeviceFeature.SOUNDDEVICEFEATURE_DEFAULTCOMDEVICE to denote
 *   default communication device on Windows.
 * - New struct #BearWare.WebRTCAudioPreprocessor for configurating WebRTC audio preprocessor.
 * - New enum value #AudioPreprocessorType.WEBRTC_AUDIOPREPROCESSOR for #BearWare.WebRTCAudioPreprocessor.
 * - New field @c webrtc in #BearWare.AudioPreprocessor for #BearWare.WebRTCAudioPreprocessor.
 * - New enum value #StreamType.STREAMTYPE_CHANNELMSG for enable/disabling channel text messages.
 * - New enum value #ChannelType.CHANNEL_HIDDEN for creating hidden channels. See @ref v57ahiddenchan.
 * - New enum value #UserRight.USERRIGHT_VIEW_HIDDEN_CHANNELS for allowing a
 *   user to view channels of type #ChannelType.CHANNEL_HIDDEN.
 * - New field @c nSoundInputDeviceDelayMSec in #BearWare.ClientStatistics for showing audio device delay.
 * - New enum value #ClientError.CMDERR_CHANNEL_CANNOT_BE_HIDDEN for given error when a channel cannot be hidden.
 * - New event TeamTalkBase.OnUserFirstVoiceStreamPacket() for sending event when new voice stream starts.
 * - New struct #BearWare.JitterConfig for configuring network jitter compensation. See @ref v57ajitter.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.SetUserJitterControl() for enabling #BearWare.JitterConfig on a #BearWare.User.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.GetUserJitterControl() for retrieving #BearWare.JitterConfig on a #BearWare.User.
 * - New variable @c \%starttick\% for audio file names. See TeamTalkBase.SetUserMediaStorageDir().
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.SetUserMediaStorageDir() for configuring when an audio log should be closed.
 * - New struct #BearWare.EncryptionContext for setting up peer verification. See @ref v57acryptcontext.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.SetEncryptionContext() for setting up peer verification.
 * - New function TeamTalkSrvBase.SetEncryptionContextEx() for setting up peer verification on a server.

 *
 * @section v56arelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.6a release, August 9th 2020
 *
 * @subsection v56afeatures New features in v5.6a
 *
 * @subsubsection v56avoicecom Android sound device for enabling voice communication mode
 *
 * A new #BearWare.SoundDevice will appear on Android when calling
 * TeamTalkBase.GetSoundDevices(). This sound device behaves the same as calling
 * Android Java class
 * android.media.AudioManager.setMode(AudioManager.MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION).
 *
 * @subsubsection v56aeffects Enable platform specific sound device effects
 *
 * Most platforms today come with their own way of toggling effects on
 * a sound device. Examples of this are echo cancellation, automatic
 * gain control (AGC), noise suppression, 3D sound positioning.
 *
 * #BearWare.SoundDevice now has a new property called @c uSoundDeviceFeatures
 * which tells what features can be enabled on the sound
 * device. Currently the list of #BearWare.SoundDeviceFeature includes:
 *
 * - #SoundDeviceFeature.SOUNDDEVICEFEATURE_AEC
 *   - This feature is currently available on Android and on Windows when
 *     using #SoundSystem.SOUNDSYSTEM_WASAPI.
 *   - Enable this feature using TeamTalkBase.SetSoundDeviceEffects()
 * - #SoundDeviceFeature.SOUNDDEVICEFEATURE_AGC
 *   - This feature is currently available on Android and on Windows when
 *     using #SoundSystem.SOUNDSYSTEM_WASAPI.
 *   - Enable this feature using TeamTalkBase.SetSoundDeviceEffects()
 * - #SoundDeviceFeature.SOUNDDEVICEFEATURE_DENOISE
 *   - This feature is currently available on Android and on Windows when
 *     using #SoundSystem.SOUNDSYSTEM_WASAPI.
 *   - Enable this feature using TeamTalkBase.SetSoundDeviceEffects()
 * - #SoundDeviceFeature.SOUNDDEVICEFEATURE_3DPOSITION
 *   - This feature is currently available on Windows when
 *     using #SoundSystem.SOUNDSYSTEM_DSOUND.
 *   - Enable this feature using TeamTalkBase.SetUserPosition()
 * - #SoundDeviceFeature.SOUNDDEVICEFEATURE_DUPLEXMODE
 *   - Enable this feature using TeamTalkBase.InitSoundDuplexDevices()
 *
 * TeamTalkBase.SetSoundDeviceEffects() is a new function in TeamTalk v5.6 which
 * can be used for enabling AGC, AEC and denoising on Windows and
 * Android.
 *
 * @subsubsection v56asharedaudio Specify sample rate and audio channels for shared sound device
 *
 * When #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG was introduced the shared sound
 * device would default to a sample rate of 48000 and stereo.
 *
 * Now it's possible to manually specify the sample rate and number of
 * audio channels using TeamTalkBase.InitSoundInputSharedDevice() and
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundOutputSharedDevice().
 * 
 * @subsubsection v56aloopback Perform sound loopback test using audio preprocessor and sound device effects
 *
 * When #BearWare.AudioPreprocessor was introduced it could not be used when
 * performing a loopback test. This is now possible using
 * TeamTalkBase.StartSoundLoopbackTestEx().
 *
 * @subsubsection v56apreprocess Sound preprocessor selection
 *
 * Previously only #BearWare.SpeexDSP was available as #BearWare.AudioPreprocessor but
 * now others can be chosing using TeamTalkBase.SetSoundInputPreprocessEx().
 *
 * @subsection v56aapi API changes in v5.6a
 *
 * - New macro #SoundSystem.SOUNDSYSTEM_AUDIOUNIT_IOS to emphasize AudioUnit for
 *   iOS. #SoundSystem.SOUNDSYSTEM_COREAUDIO actually also uses AudioUnit.
 * - New enumeration #BearWare.SoundDeviceFeature for listing features that are
 *   provided by a #BearWare.SoundDevice. See @c uSoundDeviceFeatures on
 *   #BearWare.SoundDevice.
 * - New property @c nWaveDeviceID on #BearWare.SoundDevice on non-Windows
 *   platforms. Previously this property was only shown on Windows but
 *   now it's shown on all platform. The reason for this is to have a
 *   common structure available for Python integration.
 *   - Note that this change actually breaks binary compatiblity with
 *     TeamTalk v5.5 and previous versions. See @ref v56acompat.
 * - New property @c uSoundDeviceFeatures on #BearWare.SoundDevice for showing
 *   features available when setting up a sound device.
 * - New structure #BearWare.SoundDeviceEffects for enabling specific effects
 *   on a sound device prior to initialization, e.g. echo
 *   cancellation.
 * - Modified macro #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_VOICEPREPROCESSINGIO to include
 *   #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG. Previously the iOS sound device
 *   that does voice preprocessing actually ran in its own shared
 *   device. However, with the introduction of
 *   #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG in TeamTalk v5.5 it is simpler for
 *   iOS to use the same shared device property as on Android.
 *   - Note that this change actually breaks binary compatiblity with
 *     TeamTalk v5.5 and previous versions.
 * - New macro #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_OPENSLES_VOICECOM for selecting a
 *   #BearWare.SoundDevice that uses Android OpenSL ES voice communication mode.
 * - New macro #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.TT_LOCAL_TX_USERID for only getting audio during voice
 *   transmission when using TeamTalkBase.EnableAudioBlockEvent().
 * - Added #ClientError.INTERR_AUDIOPREPROCESSOR_INIT_FAILED to #ClientError.
 * - Added #ClientError.INTERR_SNDEFFECT_FAILURE to #ClientError.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.StartSoundLoopbackTestEx() for testing a
 *   #BearWare.SoundDevice with #BearWare.AudioPreprocessor and #BearWare.SoundDeviceEffects.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.InitSoundInputSharedDevice() for specifying
 *   sample rate, frame size and mono/stereo of the input #BearWare.SoundDevice
 *   that has been initialized with #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.InitSoundOutputSharedDevice() for specifying
 *   sample rate, frame size and mono/stereo of the output
 *   #BearWare.SoundDevice that has been initialized with
 *   #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.SetSoundDeviceEffects() for enabling
 *   #BearWare.SoundDeviceEffects on a client instance prior to initialization
 *   of the #BearWare.SoundDevice.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.GetSoundDeviceEffects() for getting the
 *   #BearWare.SoundDeviceEffects on a client instance.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.SetSoundInputPreprocessEx() for selecting an
 *   #BearWare.AudioPreprocessor instead of only #BearWare.SpeexDSP in
 *   TeamTalkBase.SetSoundInputPreprocess().
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.GetSoundInputPreprocessEx() for getting the
 *   active #BearWare.AudioPreprocessor.
 * - New function TeamTalkBase.EnableAudioBlockEventEx() for requesting
 *   #BearWare.AudioBlock with the specified #BearWare.AudioFormat.
 *
 * @subsubsection v56acompat Compatibility issue with TeamTalk v5.5 and previous
 *
 * All platforms now include the property @c nWaveDeviceID on
 * #BearWare.SoundDevice. Previously this property was only shown on
 * Windows but now it's shown on all platform. This means the byte
 * offset of @c bSupports3D and onwards have changed in the
 * #BearWare.SoundDevice structure. The reason for this is to have a common
 * structure available for Python integration.
 *
 * Value of
 * #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_VOICEPREPROCESSINGIO
 * has been changed to include
 * #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG. Previously
 * the iOS sound device that does voice preprocessing actually ran in
 * its own shared device. However, with the introduction of
 * #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG in
 * TeamTalk v5.5 it is simpler for iOS to use the same shared device
 * property as on Android. Therefore ensure that
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundInputDevice() and
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundOutputDevice() is not called with 1 instead
 * of the value of
 * #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_VOICEPREPROCESSINGIO.

 * @section v55arelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.5a release, April 13 2020
 *
 * @subsection v55afeatures New features in v5.5a
 *
 * @subsubsection v55asharedaudio Shared audio input/output device
 *
 * Previously the Android platform only supported one active sound
 * input device. This meant that only one TeamTalk instance could be
 * used on Android.
 *
 * With the introduction of shared audio device it's now possible for
 * multiple TeamTalk instances to share the same audio input
 * device.
 *
 * Also for playback the TeamTalk instance can use a shared sound
 * device so playback is not limited to few simultaneous users talking
 * at the same time.
 *
 * The shared audio device on Android is same as
 * #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_OPENSLES_DEFAULT but or'ed with the flag
 * #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG. The sound device ID flag
 * #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG tells the TeamTalk instance to create a
 * shared audio device which distributes its audio to all other
 * client instances.
 *
 * The shared audio device which is created runs at the audio device's
 * highest sample rate and highest number of channels. Each client
 * which receives the audio from the shared audio device resamples the
 * audio data to its own format. This is a CPU intensive task, so many
 * clients at different sample rates uses more CPU. It is therefore
 * recommended that clients which use this feature all use channels
 * that has the same audio codec settings. Preferably @c
 * nDefaultSampleRate and @c nMaxInputChannels and @c
 * nMaxOutputChannels of the chosen #BearWare.SoundDevice.
 *
 * To initialize a shared audio input device call like this:
@verbatim
  ttInst.InitSoundInputDevice(ttInst, inputid | SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG);
@endverbatim
 * To initialize a shared audio output device call like this: 
@verbatim
  ttInst.InitSoundInputDevice(ttInst, outputid | SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_SHARED_FLAG);
@endverbatim
 *
 *
 * @subsubsection v55aplayback Playback media file
 *
 * Media files can now be played using the TeamTalk instance
 * configured sound output device. Call TeamTalkBase.InitLocalPlayback() to
 * playback a media file.
 *
 * Prior to playback it's possible to set specify an offset using
 * #BearWare.MediaFilePlayback and setup an #BearWare.AudioPreprocessor.
 *
 * While the media file is playing it's possible to use
 * TeamTalkBase.UpdateLocalPlayback() to change the media stream's
 * properties. The progress of the media file playback can be monitor
 * through #ClientEvent.CLIENTEVENT_LOCAL_MEDIAFILE.
 *
 * Stop local media file playback using TeamTalkBase.StopLocalPlayback().
 *
 * @subsubsection v55astream Control media file playback when
 * streaming to channel
 *
 * When streaming media files to a channel it's now possible to
 * specify an #BearWare.AudioPreprocessor to change the audio stream of the
 * media file.
 *
 * A new audio #BearWare.TTAudioPreprocessor is introduced with can mute
 * left/right audio channel and change gain level.
 *
 * It's also possible to change the offset and pause the media file
 * using TeamTalkBase.UpdateStreamingMediaFileToChannel() and
 * #BearWare.MediaFilePlayback.
 *
 * To use these new features use
 * TeamTalkBase.StartStreamingMediaFileToChannelEx() instead of
 * TeamTalkBase.StartStreamingMediaFileToChannel().
 *
 * @subsubsection v55atxinterval nTxIntervalMSec increased to 500 msec
 *
 * Previously the maximum transmit interval was limited to 100
 * msec. With #BearWare.OpusCodec's introduction of 120 msec frame sizes the
 * transmit interval has been increased to 500 msec.
 *
 * @subsubsection v55aopus OPUS codec frame size selection
 *
 * OPUS v1.3 introduced additional frame sizes, i.e. 80, 100 and 120
 * msec. These frame sizes can now be set using the @c nFrameSizeMSec
 * property of #BearWare.OpusCodec.
 *
 * @subsubsection v55amux Access muxed audio stream
 *
 * Previously TeamTalkBase.EnableAudioBlockEvent() could only be used to access
 * audio from a single user. Using #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.TT_MUXED_USERID now makes it
 * possible to access the audio stream where all users' audio streams
 * have been mixed together. Basically the same as recording all
 * conversations to a single file using
 * TeamTalkBase.StartRecordingMuxedAudioFile().
 *
 * @subsubsection v55aaudioinput Inject audio into channel (replace voice input)
 *
 * The #StreamType.STREAMTYPE_VOICE could previously only come from the
 * configured #BearWare.SoundDevice passed to TeamTalkBase.InitSoundInputDevice(). Now
 * it's possible to replace the, typically microphone, audio input
 * with a custom audio stream by passing raw audio in #BearWare.AudioBlock to
 * TeamTalkBase.InsertAudioBlock().
 *
 * The audio input must be passed continuesly to TeamTalkBase.InsertAudioBlock()
 * to keep the input going. Use event #ClientEvent.CLIENTEVENT_AUDIOINPUT to
 * monitor progress. The #BearWare.AudioInputProgress struct hold information
 * about the queue sizes/progress.
 *
 * @subsubsection v55akeepalive Configure TCP and UDP keep alive properties
 *
 * How often "keep alive" information should be sent depend on the
 * type of network where the TeamTalk client is deployed. Previously
 * the TCP and UDP keep alive settings have been controlled entirely
 * by the TeamTalk client instance.
 *
 * Now it's possible to configure the keep alive properties using
 * #BearWare.ClientKeepAlive-struct and functions TeamTalkBase.SetClientKeepAlive() and
 * TeamTalkBase.GetClientKeepAlive().
 *
 * @subsubsection v55arecord Record audio from multiple channels
 * 
 * Previously it was only possible to have one active audio recording using
 * TeamTalkBase.StartRecordingMuxedAudioFile().
 *
 * Now it's possible to record multiple channels at the same time
 * using TeamTalkBase.StartRecordingMuxedAudioFileEx(). Note that in order to
 * get audio from channels where the TeamTalk instance is currently
 * not participating requires the use of TeamTalkBase.DoSubscribe() and
 * #Subscription.SUBSCRIBE_INTERCEPT_VOICE.
 *
 * @subsubsection v55aencrypt Connect to encrypted TeamTalk Professional servers
 *
 * The TeamTalk 5 SDK Standard Edition could only connect to
 * unencrypted TeamTalk servers, but now it's also possible to connect
 * to encrypted servers. The TeamTalk server in TeamTalk 5 SDK,
 * however, still cannot run in encrypted mode.
 *
 * @subsubsection v55aandroidcapi TeamTalk 5 shared C-API library for Android
 *
 * Previously the Android platform only included a shared library for
 * Java Native Interface (JNI). But now it's also possible to use a
 * shared library like other platforms.

 * @section v54arelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.4a release, June 25th 2019
 *
 * @subsection v54afeatures New features in v5.4a
 *
 * TeamTalk SDKs for Android now comes with a TeamTalk JNI library for
 * 64-bit ARM and 32-bit Intel x86. Required API level is now 21
 * (Android 5.0).
 *
 * TeamTalk SDKs for Windows now uses <a
 * href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/medfound/microsoft-media-foundation-sdk">Microsoft
 * Media Foundation</a> instead of DirectShow when streaming media
 * files and capturing from video cameras. This means that Windows 10
 * users can now stream from HTTP and HTTPS.
 * 
 * TeamTalk SDK Standard Edition can now connect to encrypted TeamTalk
 * servers. Running an encrypted TeamTalk server, however, still
 * requires TeamTalk SDK Professional Edition.
 *
 * TeamTalk SDK Standard Edition can now stream HTTPS on macOS,
 * Android and Linux.
 *
 * TeamTalk SDK Standard Edition now requires libssl dependency
 * (OpenSSL).
 *
 * #BearWare.Codec.OPUS_CODEC upgraded to v1.3 on all platforms.

 *
 * @subsection v53bapi API changes in v5.3b
 *
 * The @c transmitUsers array of #BearWare.Channel now also applies to
 * #ChannelType.CHANNEL_DEFAULT but unlike a channel of type #ChannelType.CHANNEL_CLASSROOM
 * the @c transmitUsers array contains the user ID of those who cannot
 * talk. Basically the opposite of classrooms.
 *
 * The following new macros have been introduced to access
 * the @c transmitUsers array:
 * - #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.TT_CLASSROOM_USERID_INDEX
 * - #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.TT_CLASSROOM_STREAMTYPE_INDEX
 * - #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.TT_TRANSMITUSERS_FREEFORALL
 * - #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.TT_TRANSMITUSERS_USERID_INDEX

 *
 * @section v52crelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.2c release, May 8th 2017
 *
 * @subsection v52cfeatures New features in v5.2c
 * 
 * @subsubsection v52cvirtsnd Virtual sound device
 *
 * In order to record conversations using
 * TeamTalkBase.StartRecordingMuxedAudioFile() it has previously been required
 * to initialize a real sound output device in order to process audio
 * packets. It is still required to initialize the sound output device
 * but now a new virtual sound device is available which processes
 * audio packets. This virtual sound device has ID
 * #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_TEAMTALK_VIRTUAL.
 *
 * @subsubsection v52ctxqueue Transmission queue in CHANNEL_SOLO_TRANSMIT
 *
 * A new feature of the #BearWare.ChannelType.CHANNEL_SOLO_TRANSMIT channel type is that
 * the server ensures that only one user can transmit audio and media
 * files to the channel. The user's position in the transmission queue
 * can be seen in #BearWare.Channel.transmitUsersQueue array.
 *
 * @subsubsection v52csrvcb Server callbacks for TeamTalkBase.DoChangeNickname() and TeamTalkBase.DoChangeStatus()
 *
 * The server API can now intercept when a user requests to change
 * nickname or change status. This is done by calling
 * TeamTalk5Srv.UserChangeNickname and
 * TeamTalk5Srv.UserChangeStatus.
 *
 * @subsubsection v52cstatic OpenSSL again dynamically linked in Linux distributions
 *
 * The TeamTalk SDK v5.2b introduced static linking of all
 * dependencies in libTeamTalk5Pro.so but this caused problems when
 * linking an application that already included an OpenSSL
 * dependency. Therefore the Linux distributions now again requires
 * that the user installs the required OpenSSL dependency. To see what
 * OpenSSL dependency is missing run:
@verbatim
  $ ldd Library/TeamTalk_DLL/libTeamTalk5Pro.so
@endverbatim
 *
 * @subsubsection v52cdaemon Daemon scripts included for TeamTalk servers
 *
 * The SDK's @c Server folder now includes daemon scripts for Debian
 * (@c /etc/init.d) and systemd based Linux distributions.
 * 
 * @subsection v52capi API changes in v5.2c
 * 
 * - Added macro for virtual sound device #BearWare.SoundDeviceConstants.TT_SOUNDDEVICE_ID_TEAMTALK_VIRTUAL.
 * - New member variable #BearWare.Channel.transmitUsersQueue of #BearWare.Channel struct.
 * - Added macro for size of transmissionUsersQueue #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.TT_TRANSMITQUEUE_MAX.
 * - Added server callback TeamTalk5Srv.OnUserChangeNickname
 * - Added server callback TeamTalk5Srv.OnUserChangeStatus
 *
 * @subsubsection v52crename TeamTalk class renamed to TeamTalkBase
 *
 * Previously the @c TeamTalk class was used by both the Professional
 * and Standard edition of the TeamTalk SDK but from now on the
 * TeamTalk 5 Professional SDK must instantiate #BearWare.TeamTalk5Pro
 * class and TeamTalk 5 Standard Edition must instantiate
 * #BearWare.TeamTalk5 class. Both #BearWare.TeamTalk5 and
 * #BearWare.TeamTalk5Pro classes inherit from #BearWare.TeamTalkBase.
 *
 * This change has been made to ensure the distinction between the two
 * SDKs and also to make the .NET API streamlined with the Java API.

 *
 * The TeamTalk server API is now also supported by .NET. Checkout the
 * #BearWare.TeamTalk5Srv class which runs the server. To quickly get
 * started it's probably a good idea to checkout @ref ttservernet.
 *
 * @subsection v52bbugfixes Bugfixes in v5.2b
 *
 * - Fixed severe issue causing audio playback not to start if client
 *   received bursts of audio packets (the client has a 1 second
 *   buffer which would overflow and not restart).
 * - Fixed @c nChannelID not being set in #BearWare.User-struct when using
 *   TeamTalk Server API.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * @section v52arelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.2a release, January 8th 2017
 *
 * @subsection v52afeatures New features in v5.2a
 *
 * @subsubsection v52asrvapi TeamTalk Server API with System ID
 *
 * The server API has been updated in this release so it's possible to
 * restrict logins to your TeamTalk server to only your own client
 * application. If the "normal" TeamTalk client tries to connect to
 * your TeamTalk server then it will be possible to reject it.
 *
 * To limit access to your TeamTalk server you can use the @c
 * szSystemID parameter of TeamTalkSrv.StartServerSysID(). When a client has to
 * connect then the chosen system-ID will also have to passed to
 * TeamTalkBase.ConnectSysID(). If it's not then the connecting TeamTalk client
 * will receive the #ClientError.CMDERR_INCOMPATIBLE_PROTOCOLS. The szSystemID of
 * the default TeamTalk application is "teamtalk". This is what you
 * see when you connect with Telnet on port TCP port 10333
 * (non-encrypted).
 *
 * On top of the system-ID restriction it's now also possible to do a
 * check on the client name connecting by using the extended
 * TeamTalkBase.DoLoginEx(). When a client tries to connect to a TeamTalk server
 * you can then check the @c szClientName property of #BearWare.User to ensure
 * only your client application is allowed to connect.
 *
 * @subsubsection v52aaudunit Voice-Processing I/O Unit for iOS
 *
 * Audio device "Voice-Processing I/O Unit" added as sound device ID 1
 * on iOS. The Voice-Processing I/O Unit sound device is designed to
 * eliminate echo when using speaker output and also enable automatic
 * gain control. Read more on audio units here:
 * https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/AudioUnitHostingGuide_iOS/UsingSpecificAudioUnits/UsingSpecificAudioUnits.html
 *
 * @subsubsection v52av4l2 Video4Linux2 (V4L2) support on Linux
 *
 * The video capture API on Linux has been updated to it now uses V4L2
 * instead of the obsolete V4L API.
 *
 * @subsubsection v52aavf AVFoundation replaces QTkit on Mac OS
 *
 * The previously used video capture API, QTkit, on Mac OS has been
 * replaced by AVFoundation. Apple's AppStore doesn't accept apps
 * which link to QTkit, so therefore this replacement was nescessary.
 *
 * @subsubsection v52adeps Dependencies on Linux has been reduced
 *
 * Previous releases of TeamTalk 5 shared library depended on WebM
 * (libvpx), Speex (libspeex), OPUS (libopus), etc. Now this has been
 * limited to C++ standard library (libstdc++) and ALSA (libasound).
 *
 * @subsubsection v52aagc Sound Preprocessing (Automatic gain control) for iOS
 *
 * The Speex sound preprocessing library (SpeexDSP) is now also
 * supported on iOS platforms.
 *
 * The #BearWare.SpeexDSP-struct is used by
 * TeamTalkBase.SetSoundInputPreprocess() and
 * TeamTalkBase.StartSoundLoopbackTest().
 *
 * @subsubsection v52attand TeamTalk for Android now uses Android Studio
 *
 * Previously the TeamTalk sample application (TeamTalkAndroid) was
 * using Eclipse but this project has now been converted to Android
 * Studio 2.0.
 *
 * @subsubsection v52aogg Store audio in .ogg format
 *
 * When storing audio to files it's now possible to specify
 * #AudioFileFormat.AFF_CHANNELCODEC_FORMAT which is part of the enumeration
 * #BearWare.AudioFileFormat. The #AudioFileFormat.AFF_CHANNELCODEC_FORMAT will store in the
 * audio format configured by a #BearWare.Channel's #BearWare.AudioCodec.
 *
 * @subsection v52aapi API changes in v5.2a
 *
 * @subsubsection v52awebm Deadline for WebM video encoder
 *
 * Added @c nEncodeDeadline to #BearWare.WebMVP8Codec which specifies quality
 * of the video encoder. Values are
 * #BearWare.WebMVP8CodecConstants.WEBM_VPX_DL_REALTIME,
 * #BearWare.WebMVP8CodecConstants.WEBM_VPX_DL_GOOD_QUALITY and
 * #BearWare.WebMVP8CodecConstants.WEBM_VPX_DL_BEST_QUALITY.
 *
 * @subsubsection v52aclientname Get software client used by peer
 *
 * Added @c szClientName to #BearWare.User-struct. The client name is specified
 * in TeamTalkBase.DoLoginEx().
 *
 * @subsubsection v52aconsys Limit access to TeamTalk server to one software client
 *
 * If using TeamTalk 5 SDK Professional then a System-ID can be used
 * to limit access to the TeamTalk server to a single client
 * application.
 *
 * Use the TeamTalk server API to setup a server with a System-ID,
 * i.e. TTS_StartServerSysID() and then use BearWare.TeamTalkBase.ConnectSysID().
 *
 * @subsection v52abugfixes Bugfixes in v5.2a
 *
 * - Stream media files was slow to start.
 * - Streaming media file from Windows caused bottom-up bitmap image.
 * - Fixed file handle being leaked on Windows during desktop transmission.
 * - Fixed corrupt .wav file if file greater than 4GB.
 * - Fixed Bluetooth not working on iOS 10 and later.

 * The TeamTalk .NET DLL project has been moved to @c
 * Library/TeamTalkBase.NET.
 * The TeamTalk JNI DLL has been moved to @c Library/TeamTalkJNI.
 *
 * This file layout change has been made so the projects are more

 *
 * @subsection v51capi API changes in v. 5.1c
 *
 * Added function TeamTalkBase.PumpMessage() for getting latest #BearWare.User-state. 
 *
 * Sound device 1 (speaker output) removed from TeamTalk iOS SDK when
 * calling TeamTalkBase.GetSoundDevices(). Instead use iOS's function @c
 * AVAudioSession.setMode().
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * @section v51brelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.1b release, October 3rd 2015
 *
 * A quite severe bug which caused files on the server to end up in
 * the wrong channels has been fixed in this minor release. The issue
 * only affects the standalone servers which are included in the
 * SDK. Custom servers created by the TeamTalk server API should not
 * be affected.
 *
 * @subsection v51bfeatures New features in v. 5.1b
 *
 * @subsubsection v51bownstream Record own voice stream to separate file
 *
 * Previously it has only been possible to record own audio streams by
 * subscribing to them. Now it's, however, possible to call
 * TeamTalkBase.SetUserMediaStorageDir() with user ID 0 to record own audio
 * stream.
 *
 * @subsubsection v51bwinjni TeamTalk JNI DLL for Windows
 *
 * Windows developers can now also use Java for client
 * development. The TeamTalk JNI DLL is located in @c
 * Library/Java/TeamTalkJNI.
 *
 * <hr>
 * 
 * @section v51arelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.1a release, June 13th 2015
 *
 * The inclusion of the @ref serverapi has caused quite a bit of
 * reorganization of the TeamTalk SDK's file layout. Previously the
 * TeamTalk DLL only allowed client operations and was therefore
 * located in the @c Client folder. Now that the TeamTalk DLL (in the
 * Professional edition) also allows users to develop a TeamTalk
 * server then the core TeamTalk library projects have been moved to
 * the @c Library folder in the root of the SDK.

 *
 * @subsubsection v51aserverapi TeamTalk 5 Server API
 *
 * The TeamTalk 5 Professional Edition now includes a @ref serverapi
 * which enables developers to instantiate a TeamTalk server by
 * calling the TeamTalk DLL. With the server API it's possible to do
 * basic operations like authentication users and updating server
 * properties.
 * 
 * Note that the TeamTalk server API is currently only supported in
 * the TeamTalk C-API DLL.
 *
 * @subsubsection v51ajava TeamTalk 5 Java DLL
 *
 * Now that the TeamTalk SDK is also available for Android the Java
 * API used for Android development has also been ported to Linux and
 * Mac OS X.
 *
 * Java is supported by using a new TeamTalk DLL with a Java Native
 * Interface (JNI). The TeamTalk JNI DLL is located in @c
 * Library/Java/TeamTalkJNI.
 * 
 * Open the Java documentation to see how to use the new Java API. The
 * Java TeamTalk classes greatly ressemble the .NET classes therefore
 * the API documentation for Java is the same as .NET. Hopefully this
 * doesn't cause too much confusion.
 * 
 * @subsubsection v51aios TeamTalk 5 SDK for iOS
 *
 * The iOS platform is now also supported by the TeamTalk DLL. Please

 *
 * @section v50arelease TeamTalk 5 SDK v. 5.0a release, March 15th 2015
 *
 * @subsection v50afeatures New features in v. 5.0a
 *
 * @subsubsection v50aeventhandling Updated event handling
 *
 * In TeamTalk 4 events were posted in a @c TTMessage containing a
 * WPARAM and LPARAM where the WPARAM would typically contain an ID
 * and the LPARAM some extended information about the event. When an
 * event occured the client application would query the TeamTalk
 * client instance to extract information about what had changed to
 * the current state. Since the client instance was running in its own
 * thread the state change could, however, have become unknown in the
 * meantime. If e.g. a text message was received from a user and the
 * user would immediately quit afterwards then the text message would
 * be lost since the text message was "attached" to the user who was
 * no longer there. In TeamTalk 5 a #BearWare.TTMessage now contains a
 * copy of what changed as a cause of the event. If e.g. a text
 * message is received from a user then the #BearWare.TTMessage will
 * contain a full copy of the #BearWare.TextMessage which was
 * received. Also if a new channel is created then it's no longer
 * required to extract the #BearWare.Channel object through the
 * TeamTalk client instance (using TeamTalkBase.GetChannel()) now the new
 * channel is part of the #BearWare.TTMessage using the
 * #BearWare.TTMessage's data container.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50awebm WebM replaces Theora video codec
 *
 * Theora video codec was used in TeamTalk 4 to encode video from
 * webcam and media files but this has now been replaced by the more
 * recent Google-backed WebM codec. Check out <a
 * href="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM</a> website for more
 * information about the new video codec. Currently it's only possible
 * to configure the bitrate in the codec but should you need access to
 * more codec configuration options then feel free to request these.
 * 
 * @subsubsection v50aopus OPUS replaces CELT audio codec
 *
 * CELT is no longer being developed and has been replaced by
 * OPUS. Check out <a href="http://www.opus-codec.org/">OPUS</a>
 * website for more information.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50aaes AES encryption replaces Blowfish
 *
 * TeamTalk 4 used Blowfish for encrypting audio, video and desktop
 * sharing streams. TeamTalk 5 uses AES 256-bit for encrypting audio,
 * video, media file and desktop sharing streams.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50amediastream New stream type for media files
 *
 * In TeamTalk 4 streaming a media file would replace voice input from
 * microphone and video from a media file would replace webcam
 * input. In TeamTalk 5 a new stream type for media files has been
 * introduced so it's still possible to talk and show webcam video
 * while streaming a media file to a channel.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50auserrights User rights now moved to user account
 *
 * In TeamTalk 4 all users of the default user type had the same user
 * rights on the server which were set up in
 * #BearWare.ServerProperties. The user rights (#BearWare.UserRight)
 * are now part of #BearWare.UserAccount so each user can have
 * different #BearWare.UserRight on the server.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50abitratelimit Audio codec bitrate limit moved to user account
 *
 * The maximum bitrate for audio codecs where global to all users in
 * TeamTalk 4 but now the maximum bitrate a user can use for a new
 * channel is configured in the #BearWare.UserAccount.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50amaxchannels Max channels limited to 4000
 *
 * TeamTalk 4 supported 65000 active channels/rooms but in TeamTalk 5
 * only 4000 channels are supported. This limited has been implemented
 * to reduce bandwidth usage.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50ap2p Peer to peer support has been removed
 *
 * TeamTalk 5 doesn't support P2P connections since the 'forward
 * through server' is required for desktop sharing to work.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50achanrename Channels can be renamed
 *
 * In TeamTalk 4 is was not possible to update a channel's name but
 * this is now supported. Ensure to update @c szInitChannel of
 * #BearWare.UserAccount if you use this feature.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50adaemon Daemon script for server included
 *
 * The TeamTalk 5 Linux server now includes a daemon script which can
 * be put in @c /etc/init.d on Debian to start/stop the TeamTalk
 * daemon (with -d option).
 *
 * @subsubsection v50aagc Audio configuration no longer forced by channel
 *
 * If a #BearWare.Channel was configured with an #BearWare.AudioConfig
 * in TeamTalk 4 then the client instance would automatically enable
 * this audio configuration. This is no longer the case in TeamTalk
 * 5. Now the client application must invoke TeamTalkBase.SetSoundInputPreprocess()
 * manually.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50asrvxml Default server config file renamed to tt5srv.xml
 *
 * The default name for the server xml configuration file was @c
 * tt4svc.xml in TeamTalk 4 but in TeamTalk 5 it's now @c tt5srv.xml
 * and @c tt5prosrv.xml for the Professional edition.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50astats Server statistics updated
 *
 * #BearWare.ServerStatistics now includes the number of users served, the
 * highest number of users and server's uptime.
 *
 * @subsubsection v50anocrypt Non-encrypted mode in Professional server
 *
 * The TeamTalk server in the Professional SDK (tt5prosrv) now also
 * supports non-encrypted mode. Whether to run in encrypted or
 * non-encrypted mode is configured when running the setup wizard. See
 * more in @ref serversetup.

 *
 * @subsubsection v45astream Stream Media Files to Channel
 *
 * Previously it's only been possible to stream 16-bit signed PCM
 * wave-files to a channel but in the 4.5 release it's now possible to
 * stream mp3, mpg, avi, wma, wmv, etc. to a channel. On Windows you
 * can basically stream whatever Windows Media Player can play to a
 * channel. Checkout
 * BearWare.TeamTalk.StartStreamingMediaFileToChannel() for more
 * information.
 *
 * @subsubsection v45alogin Login Attempt Limit
 *
 * To prevent a brute force login attempt it's now possible to limit
 * the number of login attempt before banning an
 * IP-address. Checkout @c nMaxLoginAttempts property of
 * @c BearWare.ServerProperties.  It's now also possible to limit the
 * number of logins per IP-address by specifying @c
 * nMaxLoginsPerIPAddress in @c BearWare.ServerProperties.
 *
 * @subsubsection v45aipban Ban user by IP-address
 *
 * Previously it was only possible to ban a user's IP-address if the
 * user was present on the server. Now it's, however, possible to ban
 * an IP-address using BearWare.TeamTalk.DoBanIPAddress().

 * @section v44arelease TeamTalk 4 SDK v. 4.4a release, September 25th 2012
 *
 * Released on 2012/10/15.
 *
 * @subsection v44afeatures New features in v. 4.4a
 *
 * @subsubsection v44awasapi Support for Windows Audio Session
 *
 * Windows Audio Session is a new sound system available in Windows
 * Vista and later versions of Windows. It's a sound system which
 * provides significantly lower latency than both DirectSound and
 * Windows default sound devices. Check out @c SoundSystem.SOUNDSYSTEM_WASAPI for
 * more information.
 * 
 * @subsubsection v44arestartsnd Restart Sound System
 *
 * When the TeamTalk client is initially start it scan the system for
 * all sound devices but if a user later plugs in a USB sound card
 * then this device will not be detected automatically in
 * TeamTalk.GetSoundInputDevices() and TeamTalk.GetSoundOutputDevices().
 *
 * TeamTalk.RestartSoundSystem() can now be used to shut down the sound
 * systems can rescan for new devices.
 *
 * @subsubsection v44aautoresam Automatic resampling of unsupported sample rates
 *
 * If a sound card doesn't support the sampling rate of a codec or if
 * the codec requires stereo input then TeamTalk now automatically
 * resamples audio so it fits the proper format. DirectSound e.g. had
 * problems with input devices which only allowed mono and therefore
 * couldn't be used with stereo codecs.
 *
 * @subsubsection v44aoprecv Operator receive-only channel type
 *
 * A new channel type, @c BearWare.ChannelType @c
 * CHANNEL_OPERATOR_RECVONLY has now also been introduced which only
 * allowed administrators and operators of a channel to receive audio
 * and video. This can be useful if bandwidth is a problem.
 *
 * @subsubsection v44anoncrypt Encrypted client (Pro-Edition) can connect to non-encrypted servers
 *
 * The client in the TeamTalk 4 Professional Edition can now also
 * connect to non-encrypted TeamTalk server. Use
 * TeamTalk.ConnectNonEncrypted() to do this.
 *
 * @subsubsection v44aviduni Unicode video device names
 *
 * @c BearWare.VideoCaptureDevice now shows the name of the video device in Unicode on Windows.
 *
 * @subsection v4aaapi API Changes in v4.4a

 * @section v43arelease TeamTalk 4 SDK v. 4.3a release, March 18th 2012
 *
 * Released on 2012/03/26.
 *
 * @subsection v43afeatures New features in v. 4.3a
 *
 * @subsubsection v43adesktop Share Desktop Applications
 *
 * The major new feature in the 4.3 release is the ability to
 * share desktop applications. When sharing a desktop application you
 * send a bitmap, using TeamTalk.SendDesktopWindow(), to the local client
 * instance. The bitmap is then split into in small blocks and
 * transmitted to the server using the UDP connection. Read more about
 * this feature in the section @ref desktopshare.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43ainitialchan Join channel after login
 *
 * A @c BearWare.UserAccount now has the @c szInitChannel property which holds
 * the channel a user should join after login. The user can join this
 * channel without passing a password. Use TeamTalk.GetMyUserAccount() to
 * get the local instance's @c BearWare.UserAccount after login has completed.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43aautoop Automatically become channel operator
 *
 * A user can automatically become operator of a @c BearWare.Channel configured
 * with @c ChannelType @c CHANNEL_STATIC if the channel's ID is in the @c
 * autoOperatorChannels property of @c BearWare.UserAccount.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43acustommsgtype Custom message type
 *
 * An extra message type has been added for custom messages. The
 * @c TextMsgType @c TextMsgType.MSGTYPE_CUSTOM works in the same way as @c TextMsgType @c TextMsgType.MSGTYPE_USER.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43aquerymtu Query maximum UDP packet size
 *
 * Some routers don't allow UDP packets over a given size so use
 * TeamTalk.QueryMaxPayload() after connecting to a server to detect the
 * maximum size for UDP packets. The event
 * TeamTalk.OnMaxPayloadUpdate() is triggered when the client
 * instance has finished querying.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43aaudioblock Access raw audio data
 *
 * The raw audio, which has been playing when a user is talking, can
 * now be accessed by calling TeamTalk.EnableAudioBlockEvent(). The event
 * TeamTalk.OnUserAudioBlock() is triggered when a new @c BearWare.AudioBlock is
 * available.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43aaudiofilename Get name of file being recorded to
 *
 * If audio files are being recorded separately for every @c BearWare.User, using
 * @c TeamTalk.SetUserAudioFolder, the file name of the file currently being
 * recorded to can be found in the @c szAudioFileName property of the
 * @c BearWare.User struct.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43aresetaudiofile Reset recorded audio file
 *
 * To cancel and start recording to a new audio file pass @c AudioFileFormat @c AudioFileFormat.AFF_NONE as
 * parameter to @c TeamTalk.SetUserAudioFolder. This will reset the current
 * recording and generate the TeamTalk.OnUserAudioFile() event.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43achanechovideo See own video stream
 *
 * A @c BearWare.Channel can now be configured using the @c ChannelType @c CHANNEL_ECHO_VIDEO flag
 * for echoing the video stream transmitted by the local client
 * instance.
 *
 * @subsubsection v43afreeforall Free-for-all option in classrooms
 *
 * A @c BearWare.Channel configured using @c ChannelType @c ChannelType.CHANNEL_CLASSROOM was previously
 * limited to 16 people transmitting either video or audio. Now it's,
 * however, possible to add @c BearWare.TeamTalk.TT_CLASSROOM_FREEFORALL to the "enabled"
 * users properties to allow everyone to transmit.

 * @section v42arelease TeamTalk 4 SDK v. 4.2a release, November 1st 2011
 *
 * Released on 2011/11/02.
 *
 * @subsection v42afeatures New features in v. 4.2a
 *
 * @subsubsection v42amuxaudio Muxed audio files
 *
 * It is now possible to store "muxed" audio files, i.e. audio from
 * all users are written to the same audio file. Check out
 * BearWare.StartRecordingMuxedAudioFile() on how to do this.
 *
 * @subsubsection v42awinfirewall Windows XP/Vista/7 Firewall
 *
 * The Windows Firewall, included in XP and later Windows versions,
 * can sometimes block network traffic to and from applications which
 * uses the TeamTalk DLL. Check out the section @ref firewall on how
 * to use the Windows Firewall functions.
 *
 * @subsubsection v42atalkdelay Modify "talking" delay
 *
 * Voice activation is by default disabled if no audio has reached the
 * voice activation level for 1.5 seconds. This option can now be
 * changed by calling TeamTalk.SetVoiceActivationStopDelay(). Also
 * users who are talking are set to non-talking after 0.5 seconds if
 * no new voice data has been received. This value can now be changed
 * by calling TeamTalk.SetUserStoppedTalkingDelay().
 *
 * @subsubsection v42avbrcodecs VBR audio codecs
 *
 * Speex and CELT can now be used in VBR mode by creating a @c BearWare.Channel
 * with the @c BearWare.SpeexVBRCodec or @c BearWare.CELTVBRCodec. To
 * limit bandwidth usage it is advised to use the VBR
 * codecs. Especially the Speex VBR codec with DTX enabled reduces
 * throughput when there's silence.
 * 
 * @subsubsection v42acelt011 CELT updated to version 0.11
 *
 * CELT 0.5.2, which was used in v 4.1 and previous of the SDK, has been
 * replaced by CELT 0.11. Note that encoding and decoding of CELT 0.5.2 
 * is no longer supported. Check out http://www.celt-codec.org
 *
 * @subsubsection v42aipv6 IPv6 support (Windows 2000 no longer supported)
 *
 * Client and server now support IPv6. To make the server run in IPv6
 * mode the server must bind to an IPv6 address. Check out @ref srvconfig
 * on how to specify the bind IP-address (\<bind-ip\> tag).
 *
 * Note that the TeamTalk DLL can no longer run on Windows 2000 since
 * this platform does not support IPv6.

 * @section v41arelease TeamTalk 4 SDK v. 4.1a release, October 30th 2010
 *
 * Released on 2010/10/30.
 *
 * @subsection v41afeatures New Features in v. 4.1a release
 *
 * The new features in the TeamTalk 4 SDK v. 4.1a has are described in
 * the following subsections.
 *
 * @subsubsection v41adeps Removed Microsoft C Runtime dependency
 *
 * The .NET wrapper for the TeamTalk 4 C-API DLL is now written in C@c  so
 * there's no longer a need to include the Microsoft C Runtime files.
 *
 * @subsubsection v41aplatforms Mac OS X and Windows Mobile platforms
 *
 * Mac OS X is now supported using the C-API DLL. The C-API DLL is
 * compiled for i386 uses QuickTime for video and CoreAudio for audio.
 * Windows Mobile support is now also supported using both the C-API
 * DLL and the .NET Framework DLL.
 *
 * @subsubsection v41aecho Echo Cancellation
 *
 * When initializing the client instance's sound system in duplex mode
 * it is now possible to enable echo cancellation. Note, however, that
 * echo cancellation performs poorly on Windows whereas it's very
 * effective on Mac OS X and Linux. Check out
 * BearWare.TeamTalk.InitSoundDuplexDevices() and
 * BearWare.TeamTalk.EnableEchoCancellation() on how to use echo
 * cancellation.
 *
 * @subsubsection v41aclassroom Classroom channel-type
 *
 * A new channel-type called classroom has now been introduced where
 * the channel's operator can control who is allowed to transmit audio
 * and video to a channel. The channel operator can then work as sort
 * of a teacher where the teacher selects the people who should answer
 * questions. Check out @c BearWare.ChannelType @c ChannelType.CHANNEL_CLASSROOM for how to create classroom
 * channels.
 *
 * @subsubsection v41aaudiocfg Channel based audio configuration
 *
 * Often users have set their microphones to different audio levels so
 * it's hard to hear certain users and others are too loud. When
 * creating a channel it's now possible to use @c BearWare.Channel's @a audiocfg
 * member to set the same audio level for all users. Note that all
 * users must use the v. 4.1a release for this to work.
 *
 * @subsubsection v41asrvstats Server Statistics
 *
 * Administrators can now query a server statistics using the command
 * BearWare.TeamTalk.DoQueryServerStats() and thereby get an overview
 * of bandwidth usage.
 *
 * @subsubsection v41avideo Simpler video extraction
 * 
 * Using BearWare.TeamTalk.GetUserVideoFrame() is quite tricky to use
 * since the developer must first query for how much memory must be
 * allocated to store the video frame. In this new release it's
 * possible to share memory with the client instance so one simply
 * calls BearWare.TeamTalk.AcquireUserVideoFrame() to get a pointer
 * to a user's video data.  when one has completed using the video
 * frame call BearWare.TeamTalk.ReleaseUserVideoFrame() to release
 * the shared memory. Note that only one video frame can be extracted
 * each time, therefore calling
 * BearWare.TeamTalk.AcquireUserVideoFrame() twice will simply result
 * in getting the same video frame.
 *
 * @subsection v41aapi API Changes in v4.1a
 *
 * - @c BearWare.TeamTalk.ConnectEx()
 *   - This function has now been introduced which allows to
 *     specify the IP-address to bind to on the local interface.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.OnCmdSuccess()
 *   - Whenever the client issues a command to the server (BearWare.TeamTalk.Do* 
 *     functions) this message will be posted if the command was 
 *     successful.
 * - @c BearWare.SoundSystem @c SoundSystem.SOUNDSYSTEM_COREAUDIO
 *   - Support for Mac OS X sound system.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.InitSoundDuplexDevices()
 *   - Initialize both sound input and output devices simultaneously.
 *     In duplex mode all users' playback streams will be mixed into
 *     a single stream. Duplex mode most be enabled if echo cancellation
 *     is to be used.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.CloseSoundDuplexDevices()
 *   - When running in duplex mode this function must be used to close
 *     down audio capture and playback.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.StartSoundLoopbackTestEx()
 *   - Same as BearWare.TeamTalk.StartSoundLoopbackTest() both with @c BearWare.AudioConfig and
 *     echo cancellation.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.SetDenoiseLevel()
 *   - Specify how agressive denoise should be when @c BearWare.TeamTalk.EnableDenoising()
 *     is enabled.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.GetDenoiseLevel()
 *   - Getter for BearWare.TeamTalk.SetDenoiseLevel().
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.EnableEchoCancellation()
 *   - For echo cancellation to be enabled the sound system must have been
 *     initialized in duplex mode using BearWare.TeamTalk.InitSoundDuplexDevices(). Note
 *     that echo cancellation performs poorly on Windows.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.AcquireUserVideoFrame()
 *   - Extract a user's video frame in a @c BearWare.VideoFrame struct. Call
 *     BearWare.TeamTalk.ReleaseUserVideoFrame() to release the memory referenced in the
 *     @c BearWare.VideoFrame.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.ReleaseUserVideoFrame()
 *   - Release the resources held by the client instance so a new video frame
 *     can be extracted. Never use the @c BearWare.VideoFrame from 
 *     BearWare.TeamTalk.AcquireUserVideoFrame() again after this call.
 * - @c BearWare.AudioConfig
 *   - When creating a @c BearWare.Channel using BearWare.TeamTalk.DoMakeChannel() or
 *     BearWare.TeamTalk.DoJoinChannel() it is now possible to specify an audio
 *     configuration so all users will speak at the same volume level.
 * - @c BearWare.ChannelType @c ChannelType.CHANNEL_CLASSROOM
 *   - This is a new channel-type where a channel operator or
 *     administrator can select which users are allowed to talk and
 *     send video to a channel. Use @a voiceUsers and @a videoUsers
 *     members of @c BearWare.Channel to select who is allowed to transmit then
 *     afterwards call BearWare.TeamTalk.DoUpdateChannel().
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.DoChannelOpEx()
 *   - Make another user operator of a channel by specifying the
 *     @c BearWare.Channel's operator password.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.DoQueryServerStats()
 *   - Ask the server for statistics regarding bandwidth usage.
 * - BearWare.TeamTalk.GetServerStatistics()
 *   - After a successful call to BearWare.TeamTalk.DoQueryServerStats() extract the server's
 *     statistics in a @c BearWare.ServerStatistics struct.

 * @section v40crelease TeamTalk 4 SDK v. 4.0c release, March 7th 2010
 *
 * Released on 2010/03/16.
 *
 * @subsection v40cfeatures New Features in v. 4.0c
 *
 * The new features in the TeamTalk 4 SDK v. 4.0c has are described in
 * the following subsections.
 *
 * @subsubsection v40cuseraccount Note-field and user-data for user accounts
 * 
 * The @c BearWare.UserAccount struct now has a new member called @a
 * szNote which can contain extra information about a user
 * account. The @c BearWare.UserAccount and @c BearWare.User structs now
 * also has a @a nUserData integer field which can be used by
 * developers to store an application specific value. After a
 * successful login the @a nUserData field on @c BearWare.UserAccount
 * will be transferred to the @a nUserData field on the @c BearWare.User
 * struct.
 *
 * @subsubsection v40cmyaccount Get "my" User Account
 *
 * After login it's now possible to retrieve one's own
 * @c BearWare.UserAccount by calling
 * BearWare.TeamTalk.GetMyUserAccount(). BearWare.TeamTalk.GetMyUserData()
 * can be used to extract one's @a nUserData of one's
 * @c BearWare.UserAccount.
 * 
 * @subsubsection v40cserverusers Extract all Users on the Server
 *
 * All users who are connected to a server can now be retrieved using
 * BearWare.TeamTalk.GetServerUsers().
 *
 * @subsection v40capi API Changes in v4.0c
 *
 * The folder for audio storage has now been placed in @c BearWare.User
 * instead of on @c BearWare.Channel. Audio storage is therefore user
 * specific now instead of channel specific.
 *
 * Renamed/modified functions:
 *
 * - @c BearWare.TeamTalk.SetChannelAudioFolder
 *   - Call @c BearWare.TeamTalk.SetUserAudioFolder instead.
 *
 * @subsection v40cbugfixes Bug fixes in v. 4.0c

 *
 * @subsection v40afeatures New Features in v. 4.0a
 * 
 * The new features in the TeamTalk 4 SDK v. 4.0a has are described in
 * the following subsections.
 *
 * @subsubsection chvidcap Video Capturing from WebCams
 *
 * TeamTalk can now capture video from webcams and encode it for
 * transmission. Bandwidth usage can be as low as a 2-3 KBytes/sec in
 * low resolutions. High resultions are, of course, also supported.
 *
 * To start using the new video features checkout the following 
 * new functions:   
 *
 * - Call TeamTalk.GetVideoCaptureDevices() to get a list 
 *   of available capture devices.
 * - Call TeamTalk.InitVideoCaptureDevice() to initialize
 *   the video capture device.
 * - Process TeamTalk.OnUserVideoFrame() event.
 * - Call TeamTalk.EnableTransmission() to transmit video
 *   data.
 *
 * @subsubsection chuseradmin User Accounts
 *
 * The TeamTalk server can now be set to only allow users to log on if
 * they have a user account on the server. The user account also
 * introduces user types, so some users can have administrator
 * capabilities.
 *
 * Read the section @ref srvconfig on how to configure the server with
 * user accounts. To see the new functions in the TeamTalk DLL for
 * handling user accounts check out the following new functions:
 *
 * - Call TeamTalk.DoNewUserAccount() to create a new user
 *   account. The user doing this must be administrator, i.e.
 *   @c UserType @c UserType.USERTYPE_ADMIN.
 * - Call TeamTalk.DoDeleteUserAccount() to delete a user account.
 * - Call TeamTalk.DoListUserAccounts() to list all user accounts
 *   on the server.
 *
 * @subsubsection chcmdid Track Command Completion
 *
 * When calling any of the client to server commands listed in
 * section @ref commands a command ID is returned to the user
 * application. This command ID can be used to track when the server
 * has started and finished processing the command using the
 * TeamTalk.OnCmdProcessing() event.
 *
 * @subsubsection chp2p Improved P2P Connections
 *
 * The TeamTalk client now has better support for peer to peer data
 * transmission and can now penetrate most NAT devices.
 *
 * Check out section @a REMOVED for more information on P2P
 * networking. P2P networking is enabled using the following
 * functions:
 *
 * - Call TeamTalk.EnablePeerToPeer() to enable/disable
 *   peer to peer connections.
 *
 * @subsubsection chcelt Support for CELT audio codec
 *
 * TeamTalk now not only supports the Speex codec, but also the CELT
 * codec. The CELT codec gives much better audio quality but also
 * requires higher bandwidth usage. If a user application is used to
 * transmit music it is advised to use CELT since the sound quality
 * will be must better than Speex. Speex is mainly for voice
 * transmissions. Check out section @ref codecs to read more about the
 * new codec.
 *
 * Also note that the audio codec used by a client is now configured
 * on a @c BearWare.Channel and not on each individual client. This
 * means that all users in a channel must now use the same audio
 * settings. This restriction has been set to support
 * echo-cancellation which is on the @ref knownissues.
 *
 * @subsection v40aapi API Changes in v. 4.0a
 *
 * The COM DLL has been removed from the SDK since most developers
 * used .NET for their client applications. These developers should
 * now use the .NET DLL instead. Here are the changes from the
 * TeamTalk 3 COM DLL to the TeamTalk 4 .NET DLL.
