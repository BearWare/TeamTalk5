 * @page serversetup TeamTalk Server Setup Guide
 * 
 * This guide explains how to configure and run the included
 * standalone TeamTalk server on either Windows, Mac OS X or Linux.
 * If you plan to write your own TeamTalk server then check out
 * the @ref serverapi and the sample applications @ref jteamtalkserver
 * and @ref ttserverexample.
 *
 * @section serverexe TeamTalk Server Executables
 *
 * The server executables are located in the 'Server' sub-directory of
 * the SDK. Note, however, that the Android and iOS releases of the
 * SDK do not include servers.
 *
 * Here's a brief overview of the server binaries in each SDK and for
 * each platform:
 *
 * - <b>TeamTalk Standard Edition</b>
 *   - Windows server executables
 *     - @c tt5srv.exe
 *       TeamTalk server as console application.
 *     - @c tt5svc.exe
 *       TeamTalk server as an NT service.
 *   - Mac OS X and Linux server executables
 *      - @c tt5srv
 *        TeamTalk server which can run as a console application and a
 *        daemon.
 *
 * - <b>TeamTalk Professional Edition</b>
 *   - Windows server executables
 *     - @c tt5prosrv.exe
 *       TeamTalk server with encryption as console application.
 *     - @c tt5prosvc.exe
 *       TeamTalk server with encryption as an NT service.
 *   - Mac OS X and Linux server executables
 *      - @c tt5prosrv
 *        TeamTalk server with encryption which can run as a console
 *        application and a daemon.
 *   - To run in encrypted mode the server requires a certificate and private key
 *     which can be created using OpenSSL. Run the following command line
 *     using OpenSSL to generate the certificate and privte key:
 *   @verbatim
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout ttserverkey.pem -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -out ttservercert.pem -outform PEM
@endverbatim
 *
 * This section outlines the following:
 * - @ref srvconfig
 * - @ref srvstart
 * - @ref ntservice
 * - @ref ttphpadmin
 *
 * @section srvconfig Configurating the TeamTalk Server
 *
 * The TeamTalk server reads its configuration from an XML file,
 * typically @c tt5srv.xml in the Standard SDK Edition and @c
 * tt5prosrv.xml in Professional SDK Edition. This file can be edited
 * manually (using an UTF-8 aware editor) or one can choose to use
 * the @c -wizard option to the server executable.
 *
 * Below is an example a TeamTalk 5 Professional server's
 * configuration file:
@verbatim

 *
 * @section srvstart Starting a TeamTalk Server
 *
 * Try running the server executable to get an overview of the
 * possible ways to run the server.
 *
 * Note that running the NT service will not give any output since an
 * NT service doesn't have a user-interface. <b>Also note the NT
 * service must be run using the Windows Administrator account.</b>
 * 
 * @section ntservice Installing the TeamTalk Windows NT Service
 *
 * In addition to the options described in section @ref srvstart the
 * NT Service (@c tt5svc.exe or @c tt5prosvc.exe) also accepts the
 * following parameters:
 *
 * - @c -i Install the NT service.
 * - @c -s Start the NT service.
 * - @c -e Stop the NT service.
 * - @c -u Uninstall the NT service.
 *
 * <b>Note the above commands must be run using the Windows
 * Administrator account.</b> Right-click @c
 * C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe and choose "Run as Administrator".
 *
 * @subsection mntservice Installing multiple Windows NT Services
 *
 * To install multiple TeamTalk NT Services the @c sc.exe command
 * can be used. Here is an example:
 @verbatim
sc.exe create "TeamTalk Server 2" binPath= "C:\MyServer\tt5svc.exe -wd c:\MyServer" start= auto
@endverbatim
 *
 * The service in the above example will be called "TeamTalk Server 2"
 * in the NT service list. Notice the spaces after @c binPath and @c
 * start. For some strange reason these are required. To start the above
 * service run:
 @verbatim
sc.exe start "TeamTalk Server 2"
@endverbatim
 * To stop it type:
@verbatim
sc.exe stop "TeamTalk Server 2"
@endverbatim
 * To uninstall it type:
@verbatim
sc.exe delete "TeamTalk Server 2"
@endverbatim
 *
 *
 * @section ttphpadmin TeamTalk PHP Admin for remote administration
 *
 * The 'Server' sub-directory also contains a PHP script named @c
 * tt5admin.php which can be used for remote administation of a
 * TeamTalk server. The TeamTalk PHP Admin must be executed in a
 * console.
 *
 *
