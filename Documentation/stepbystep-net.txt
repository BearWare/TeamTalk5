/** @page stepbystep Client Programming Guide
 *
 * The following sections gives a step-by-step tour of how to build an
 * application which uses the TeamTalk .NET DLL to transmit voice
 * and video. This chapter assumes the developer has read the
 * section @ref clientsetup on how to configure Visual Studio to work
 * with the TeamTalk client DLL.
 *
 * In order for the user application to interact with other clients a
 * TeamTalk server must first be set up. Section @ref serversetup
 * explains how to do this. The job of the TeamTalk server is to
 * provide user autentication and keep track of users. Once a client
 * is connected and has been authenticated the client is presented
 * with a tree structure where each node is a so-called "channel"
 * which the client can join and from there interact with the other
 * users who are in the same channel.
 *
 * The following six steps explains how to build a TeamTalk client:
 *
 * - @ref stepinit
 * - @ref stepdevs
 * - @ref stepconnect
 * - @ref steplogon
 * - @ref stepjoin
 * - @ref steptx
 *
 * @section stepinit Step 1: Create a TeamTalk Client Instance
 *
 * A new client instance is created by instantiating the
 * #BearWare.TeamTalk5-class. Once the new instance has been created
 * its current state can be retrieved by calling the function
 * TeamTalkBase.GetFlags() which will return a bitmask describing
 * the client's current state. Initially after creating the client
 * instance a call to TeamTalkBase.GetFlags() will return a
 * bitmask with the value #ClientFlag.CLIENT_CLOSED since no operations have been
 * performed on the client.
 * 
 * Here a code-snip which shows how to instantiate the
 * #BearWare.TeamTalk5 class.
 @code
//...
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        BearWare.TeamTalkBase ttclient;

        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            // Here we instantiate a TeamTalk client in the TeamTalk 5 SDK Standard Edition.

            ttclient = new BearWare.TeamTalk5(false); // We pass 'false' to the constructor
                                                      // since we're a Forms application

            // In TeamTalk 5 Professional Edition the TeamTalk client instance is created
            // using: 'ttclient = new BearWare.TeamTalk5Pro(false);

            Debug.Assert(ttclient.Flags == ClientFlag.CLIENT_CLOSED);
        }
    }
//...
@endcode
 *
 * @section stepdevs Step 2: Initialize Sound and Video Devices
 *
 * Before connecting to a server it is a good idea to setup the user's
 * sound and video devices. Sound devices are initialized using the
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundInputDevice() and
 * TeamTalkBase.InitSoundOutputDevice() functions. The video capture
 * device is initialized using
 * TeamTalkBase.InitVideoCaptureDevice(). Initializing the video capture
 * device can be quite tricky because there's many properties which
 * needs to be configured. Look at the SDK sample applications to see
 * how it is done.
 *
 * Once sound and video devices has been initialized the function
 * TeamTalkBase.GetFlags() will return a mask containing
 * #ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDINPUT_READY,
 * #ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDOUTPUT_READY and
 * #ClientFlag.CLIENT_VIDEOCAPTURE_READY.
 *
 * Here a code-snip which shows how to extract extract sound and video
 * devices:
@code
//...

  SoundDevice[] snddevs;
  VideoCaptureDevice[] videodevs;

  /* extract sound and video devices and put them in UI */
  public void button3ListDevices()
  {
    /* get sound devices for recording and playback */
    ttclient.GetSoundInputDevices(out snddevs); //we should check return value...
    
    foreach(SoundDevice dev in snddevs) {
      /* add sound devices for recording to display container, say 'recComboBox' */
      if(dev.nMaxInputChannels>0)
        recComboBox.Items.Add(dev);
      /* add sound devices for playback to display container, say 'playComboBox' */
      if(dev.nMaxOutputChannels>0)
        playComboBox.Items.Add(dev);
    }

    /* get video capture devices. Here we assume there is ONE */
    ttclient.GetVideoCaptureDevices(out videodevs);  //we should check return value...
    Debug.Assert(videodevs.Length == 1);
    /* add video capture device to display container, let's say 'vidComboBox'... */

    /* here we list the capture formats supported */
    foreach(VideoFormat cap in videodevs[0].videoFormats) {
      /* add capture format to display container, let's say 'fmtComboBox' */
    }
  }

  /* when user has chosen sound and video devices they can now be initialized */
  public void button4InitDevices()
  {
    /* init sound recording device */
    ttclient.InitSoundInputDevice(snddevs[recComboBox.SelectedIndex].nDeviceID);  //we should check return value...
    Debug.Assert( (ttclient.Flags & ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDINPUT_READY) == 
                  ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDINPUT_READY );

    /* init sound playback device */
    ttclient.InitSoundOutputDevice(snddevs[playComboBox.SelectedIndex].nDeviceID);  //we should check return value...
    Debug.Assert( (ttclient.Flags & ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDOUTPUT_READY) == 
                  ClientFlag.CLIENT_SNDOUTPUT_READY );

    /* init video capture device and capture format. */
    ttclient.InitVideoCaptureDevice(videodevs[0].szDeviceName, //we pretended to have ONE
                                    videodevs[0].videoFormats[fmtComboBox.SelectedIndex]);
                                    //we should check return value...
    Debug.Assert( (ttclient.Flags & ClientFlag.CLIENT_VIDEOCAPTURE_READY) == 
                  (ClientFlag.CLIENT_VIDEOCAPTURE_READY) );
  }
//...
@endcode
 *
 * @section stepconnect Step 3: Connect to a TeamTalk Server
 *
 * Calling TeamTalkBase.Connect() will make the client connect to the
 * server running on the IP-address and port numbers specified as
 * parameters to the function. After this call the TeamTalkBase.GetFlags()
 * function will have the #ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTING bit set.
 *
 * If the TeamTalkBase.Connect() call fails the TeamTalkBase.OnConnectionFailed()
 * event will be posted by the client instance and the
 * #ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTING bit will be cleared.
 *
 * If the TeamTalkBase.Connect() is successful the
 * TeamTalkBase.OnConnectSuccess() event will be posted by the client
 * instance and the #ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTED bit will be set and
 * #ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTING will be cleared.
 *
 * Here is a code-snip which shows how to connect to a server:
@code
  /* in the constructor we should add event handlers to these two 
   * events for connecting */
  public Form1()
  {
    //..
    ttclient.OnConnectionSuccess += new TeamTalkBase.Connection(form1_OnConnectionSuccess);
    ttclient.OnConnectionFailed += new TeamTalkBase.Connection(form1_OnConnectionFailed);
    //..
  }

  /* let's say the user presses 'button1' to connect to a server and invokes this */
  public void button1ConnectToServer()
  {
      Debug.Assert( (ttclient.Flags & 
                    (ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTING | ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTED) ) ==
                    ClientFlag.CLIENT_CLOSED /* basically 0 */ );
      if( ttclient.Connect("10.10.66.2", 10333, 10333, 0, 0) == false)
          MessageBox.Show("Unable to connect!");
      else {
          //we wait for 'form1_OnConnectionSuccess' or 'form1_OnConnectionFailed'
          //to be called...
      }
  }

  /* invoked by the client instance if connection is successful */
  public void form1_OnConnectionSuccess()
  {
      MessageBox.Show("We're connected!");
      Debug.Assert( (ttclient.Flags & ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTED) ==
                    ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTED);
  }

  /* invoked by the client instance if the connection is unsuccessful */
  public void form1_OnConnectionFailed()
  {
      MessageBox.Show("Unable to connect!");
      ttclient.Disconnect(); //reset the client, so we can call .Connect() again
  }
@endcode
 * @section steplogon Step 4: Log on to a TeamTalk Server
 *
 * Once connected the user application can call TeamTalkBase.DoLogin() to
 * log on to the server. All functions with the prefix @c Do* are
 * client to server commands (see @ref commands). The
 * TeamTalkBase.DoLogin() requires that
 * the user application provides a username and password for a user
 * account on the server.
 *
 * If the server rejects the login the TeamTalkBase.OnCmdError() event is
 * posted along with an error code (see #ClientError).
 *
 * If the server accepts the login information the
 * TeamTalkBase.OnCmdMyselfLoggedIn() event is posted and the the client
 * instance will have the #ClientFlag.CLIENT_AUTHORIZED set.
 *
 * For every channel on the server a TeamTalkBase.OnCmdChannelNew() event
 * will be posted and a TeamTalkBase.OnCmdUserLoggedIn() will be posted
 * for every user on the server. The TeamTalkBase.OnCmdUserJoinedChannel()
 * will also be posted for every user who is in a channel.
 *
 * Here's a code-snip which shows how to log on to a server:
@code
  /* in the constructor we should add an event handler for login success 
   * and login failure */
  public Form1()
  {
      //..
      ttclient.OnCmdError += new TeamTalkBase.CommandError(form1_OnCmdError);
      ttclient.OnCmdMyselfLoggedIn += 
            new TeamTalkBase.MyselfLoggedIn(form1_OnCmdMyselfLoggedIn);
      //..
  }

  void button2Login()
  {
      Debug.Assert( (ttclient.Flags & ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTED) ==
                    ClientFlag.CLIENT_CONNECTED);
      if(ttclient.DoLogin("John Doe", "admin", "admin_passwd321")<0)
          MessageBox.Show("Failed to issue client/server command");
      else {
          //wait for 'ttclient_OnCmdMyselfLoggedIn' or 
          //'ttclient_OnCmdError' to be called
      }
  }

  /* invoked by client instance if login comamnd is ok */
  void ttclient_OnCmdMyselfLoggedIn(int nMyUserID)
  {
      MessageBox.Show("Log in successful");
      Debug.Assert((ttclient.Flags & ClientFlag.CLIENT_AUTHORIZED) == 
                   ClientFlag.CLIENT_AUTHORIZED);
      Debug.Assert(ttclient.UserID>0); //we have a user ID now
  }

  /* invoked by client instance if login command fails */
  void ttclient_OnCmdError(int nCmdID, ClientErrorMsg clienterrormsg)
  {
      MessageBox.Show(clienterrormsg.szErrorMsg); break;
  }
@endcode
 * @section stepjoin Step 5: Join a channel on the TeamTalk Server
 *
 * Now that the client is connected and authorized it is possible to
 * join a channel on the server. This is done by either calling the
 * function TeamTalkBase.DoJoinChannel() to create a new channel or by
 * calling TeamTalkBase.DoJoinChannelByID() to join an existing channel.
 *
 * If using the TeamTalkBase.DoJoinChannelByID() command to join a channel
 * the ID of the channel must be retrieved and also the password
 * needed (if any) to join the channel. The ID of a channel is posted
 * in the TeamTalkBase.OnCmdChannelNew() event and the password must be
 * known by the user.
 *
 * If the call to TeamTalkBase.DoJoinChannelByID() is successful the event
 * TeamTalkBase.OnCmdUserJoinedChannel() is posted and if the server
 * rejected the command to join the TeamTalkBase.OnCmdError() event is
 * posted.
 *
 * Here is a code-snip for joining a channel:
@code
  /* in the constructor we should add an event handler for 
   * joining a channel and join failure */
  public Form1()
  {
      //..
      ttclient.OnCmdError += new TeamTalkBase.CommandError(form1_OnCmdError);
      ttclient.OnCmdUserJoinedChannel += 
           new TeamTalkBase.UserUpdate(form1_OnCmdUserJoinedChannel);
      //..
  }

  /* button invoked by user to join a channel... */
  public void button7JoinChannel()
  {
    if(ttclient.DoJoinChannelByID((int)treeView.SelectedItem.Tag, 
                                  "chan_passwd123")<0)
      MessageBox.Show("Failed to issue commnand to join channel");
    else {
      //wait for either 'form1_OnCmdUserJoinedChannel' or 
      //'ttclient_OnCmdError' to be invoked
    }
  }

  /* invoked by client instance if join command succeeds */
  void form1_OnCmdUserJoinedChannel(User user)
  {
    //check if user is 'myself'
    if(user.nUserID == ttclient.GetMyUserID())
    {
      string chanpath;
      if(ttclient.GetChannelPath(user.nChannelID, out chanpath))
      {
        MessageBox.Show("Joined channel: " + chanpath);
        Debug.Assert(ttclient.ChannelID>0); //we're in a channel now...
      }
    }
  }

  /* invoked by client instance if join command fails */
  void ttclient_OnCmdError(int nCmdID, ClientErrorMsg clienterrormsg)
  {
      MessageBox.Show(clienterrormsg.szErrorMsg); break;
  }
@endcode
 * @section steptx Step 6: Transmit data to users in a Channel
 * 
 * Having joined a channel now enables the client instance to start
 * transmitting audio and video to the other users in the channel by
 * calling TeamTalkBase.EnableVoiceTransmission() and 
 * TeamTalkBase.StartVideoCaptureTransmission().
 *
 * When the other users in the channel starts receiving audio they
 * will receive the TeamTalkBase.OnUserStateChange() event. If video is also
 * being transmitted the event TeamTalkBase.OnUserVideoCapture() will be
 * posted for every video frame which is received.
 *
 * Here's a code-snip on how to transmit and display data:
@code
  /* in the constructor we should add an event handler seeing talking user and video */
  public Form1()
  {
      //..
      ttclient.OnUserStateChange += new TeamTalkBase.UserUpdate(form1_OnUserStateChange);
      ttclient.OnUserVideoCapture += new TeamTalkBase.UserVideoFrame(form1_OnUserVideoCapture);
      //..
  }

  /* user wants to transmit voice */
  public void button8TransmitVoice()
  {
    Debug.Assert(ttclient.ChannelID>0); //must be in channel or no one will receive
    ttclient.EnableVoiceTransmission(true);
  }

  /* user wants to transmit video */
  public void button9TransmitVideo()
  {
    /* Let's choose some WebM video codec settings for use with video capture */
    VideoCodec vidcodec;
    vidcodec.nCodec = Codec.WEBM_VP8_CODEC;
    vidcodec.webm_vp8.nRcTargetBitrate = 1024; //1024 KBit/sec

    Debug.Assert(ttclient.ChannelID>0); //must be in channel or no one will receive

    ttclient.StartVideoCaptureTransmission(vidcodec);
  }

  /* invoked when a user is talking */
  void form1_OnUserStateChange(User user)
  {
    if(user.uUserState.HasFlag(UserState.USERSTATE_VOICE)
      Debug.WriteLine(user.szNickName + " is talking...");
    else
      Debug.WriteLine(user.szNickName + " stopped talking...");
  }

  /* Hold VideoFrame in container for each user until it's no longer needed. */
  Dictionary<int, VideoFrame> vidframes = new Dictionary<int, VideoFrame>();

  /* invoked when a new video frame can be displayed */
  void form1_OnUserVideoCapture(int nUserID, int nStreamID)
  {
    Bitmap user_bmp;
    VideoFrame new_frame;
    new_frame = ttclient.AcquireUserVideoCaptureFrame(nUserID, out user_bmp);
    
    //'new_frame' is valid if members are non-zero
    if(new_frame.nFrameBufferSize > 0) {
      //display the 'user_bmp' bitmap in an image control...

      //release memory from previous VideoFrame stored in container
      VideoFrame old_frame;
      if(vidframes.TryGetValue(nUserID, out old_frame))
        ttclient.ReleaseUserVideoCaptureFrame(old_frame);
    }
    /* store new VideoFrame in container so it can be reused */
    vidframes[nUserID] = new_frame;
  }
@endcode
 */

}
