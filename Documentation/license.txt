/**
 * @page license License TeamTalk SDK
 *
 * The binaries included with the TeamTalk SDK are trials which will
 * disable themselves after 30 days of use. To use the TeamTalk SDK
 * in an end-user application you must purchase a license from
 * <a href="http://www.bearware.dk">BearWare.dk</a>.
 *
 * A TeamTalk SDK License is royalty-free meaning that when you have
 * purchased a license you're allowed to redistribute unlimited copies
 * of your end-user applications which use the TeamTalk
 * DLLs. Additionally the license grants you the right to run an
 * unlimited number of TeamTalk servers.
 *
 * @section purchase Purchase License
 *
 * Please visit <a
 * href="http://www.bearware.dk">BearWare.dk</a> for
 * pricing or send an email to <a
 * href="mailto:contact@bearware.dk">contact@bearware.dk</a> for more
 * information.
 *
 * @subsection netlicense Activate License in .NET DLL
 *
 * To apply the TeamTalk 5 SDK license in a .NET application call the
 * method BearWare.TeamTalk.SetLicenseInformation(). This will disable
 * trail mode.
 *
 * @code
 * class MyProgram {
 * 
 *   static void Main(string[] args) {
 *     BearWare.TeamTalk.SetLicenseInformation("MyCompany", "1234abcd");
 *     BearWare.TeamTalk ttclient = new BearWare.TeamTalk(true);
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection javalicense Activate License in Java DLL
 *
 * To apply the TeamTalk 5 SDK license in a Java application call the
 * method dk.bearware.TeamTalk5.setLicenseInformation(). This will
 * disable trail mode.
 *
 * @code
 * class MyProgram {
 *   
 *    public static void main(String[] args) {
 *      dk.bearware.TeamTalk5.loadLibrary();
 *      dk.bearware.TeamTalk5.setLicenseInformation("MyCompany", "1234abcd");
 *      dk.bearware.TeamTalk5 ttclient = new dk.bearware.TeamTalk5();
 *    }
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * In Java you must call @c dk.bearware.TeamTalk5.loadLibrary()
 * followed by @c dk.bearware.TeamTalk5.setLicenseInformation() to set
 * license name and key. The call to @c loadLibrary() ensures the
 * TeamTalk JNI DLL is loaded prior to invoking a function in the
 * DLL. Otherwise you'll see an @c UnsatisfiedLinkError.
 *
 * @subsection capilicense Activate License in C-API DLL
 *
 * To apply the TeamTalk 5 SDK license in a C API application call the
 * function TT_SetLicenseInformation(). This will disable trial mode.
 *
 * @code
 * int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
 *   TT_SetLicenseInformation("MyCompany", "1234abcd");
 *   TTInstance* ttclient = TT_InitTeamTalkPoll();
 * }
 * @endcode
