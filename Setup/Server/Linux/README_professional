TeamTalk 5 Professional Server for Debian 9
-------------------------------------------

TeamTalk 5 Professional Server works pretty much the same as the
TeamTalk 5 Server included with the TeamTalk 5 distribution. The only
difference is the following features in the TeamTalk 5 Professional
Server:

- Support for encrypted connection between clients and server
- Support for BearWare WebLogin


Quick Guide
-----------

Here's a quick introduction on how to set up a TeamTalk 5 Professional
Server which uses encrypted connections and BearWare.dk WebLogins.

First create a server certificate and private key for your TeamTalk
server by running the following command:

$ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ttserverkey.pem -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -out ttservercert.pem -outform PEM

Remember the location of the generated private key file
"ttserverkey.pem" and certificate file "ttservercert.pem".


Now run the TeamTalk 5 Professional Server's setup wizard:

$ ./tt5prosrv -wizard

When asked "Should server run in encrypted mode?" answer "Y".

The wizard will then ask you for the server's certificate file. Here
you write the location of "ttservercert.pem".

Next the wizard will ask for the server's private key file. Here you
write the location of "ttserverkey.pem".


Next up is creating the BearWare.dk WebLogin account. This account can
be created when the wizard asks to create user accounts.

Select the option "Create BearWare.dk web-login account" to enable
BearWare.dk WebLogin. The BearWare.dk WebLogin account is name
"bearware" and is a general account for all users who log on to your
server with a BearWare.dk WebLogin account.


Complete the remaining wizard items in the wizard and you're ready to
start your server:

$ ./tt5prosrv -nd -verbose

To run the server in daemon mode, so you can quit your shell, type:

$ ./tt5prosrv -d

If you have any troubles look in the following trouble shooting
section.


Trouble Shooting
----------------

If you don't have OpenSSL installed already then run:

$ sudo apt install openssl


If the tt5prosrv binary is missing dependency to libssl1.1 then run:

$ sudo apt install libssl1.1
