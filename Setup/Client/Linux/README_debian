TeamTalk 5 for Linux
--------------------

TeamTalk 5 supports ALSA sound system and PulseAudio for audio and
Video4Linux2 (V4L2) for video capture.

Officially supported Linux distributions are the follow:

- Debian 10, Raspbian 10, Ubuntu 22.04
- Debian 12, Raspberry PI OS (Bookworm), Ubuntu 24.04

Checkout the Dependencies sections to see what libraries must be
installed to run TeamTalk 5.


Run TeamTalk
------------

Use the run.sh script to start the TeamTalk client. The run.sh script
includes the shared library (libTeamTalk5.so) dependency in the library
path, LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


Known Issues
------------

There are still a couple of issues which needs to be fixed in the
TeamTalk client before it runs smoothly on Linux. These are listed
here:

- Modifier keys alone cannot be used as hotkeys. Hotkeys needs to be
  either a regular key or a regular key and a modifier key. F12 seems
  like a good key to use as a PTT key on Linux when using KDE.

- Streaming video flickers sometimes
