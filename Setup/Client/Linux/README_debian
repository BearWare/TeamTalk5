TeamTalk 5 for Debian 10 / Raspbian 10 / Ubuntu 22.04
-----------------------------------------------------

TeamTalk 5 runs on Linux using ALSA sound system for audio and
Video4Linux2 (V4L2) for video capture.


Dependencies
------------

In order to run TeamTalk the following dependencies must be
installed first:

- libqt5x11extras5
- libqt5widgets5
- libqt5multimedia5
- libqt5gui5
- libqt5network5
- libqt5xml5
- libqt5core5a
- libqt5texttospeech5 
- libasound2

To install the packages run the following command as 'root':

apt install libqt5x11extras5 libqt5widgets5 libqt5multimedia5 \
  libqt5gui5 libqt5network5 libqt5xml5 libqt5core5a libqt5texttospeech5 \
  libasound2


Run TeamTalk
------------

Use the run.sh script to start the TeamTalk client. The run.sh script
includes the shared library (libTeamTalk5.so) dependency in the library
path, LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


Known Issues
------------

There are still a couple of issues which needs to be fixed in the
TeamTalk client before it runs smoothly on Linux. These are listed
here:

- Modifier keys alone cannot be used as hotkeys. Hotkeys needs to be
  either a regular key or a regular key and a modifier key. F12 seems
  like a good key to use as a PTT key on Linux when using KDE.

- Streaming video flickers sometimes
